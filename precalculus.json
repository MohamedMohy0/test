What is the probability that the expression cos of a pi plus i sin of b pi to the power of 4 is a real number?",
        "answer": "There are twenty possible values of a and b. Let x = cos(a*pi) and y = sin(b*pi). We need to find when (x + yi)^4 is real. This happens when 4x^3y - 4xy^3 = 0, so either x = 0, y = 0, x = y, or x = -y.\n\nIf cos(a*pi) = 0, then a = 1/2 or a = 3/2, and b can be any value. This gives forty pairs (a, b).\n\nIf sin(b*pi) = 0, then b = 0 or b = 1, and a can be any value. This gives forty pairs (a, b), but four pairs have already been counted, so it gives thirty-six additional pairs.\n\nIf cos(a*pi) = sin(b*pi), then cos(a*pi) = cos(pi/2 - b*pi). This implies a*pi - (pi/2 - b*pi) = 2*pi*k or a*pi + (pi/2 - b*pi) = 2*pi*k' for some integers k and k'. These lead to a + b - 1/2 = 2*k or a - b + 1/2 = 2*k'. We have already counted the pairs where b = 0 or b = 1, so we exclude these values. \n\nWe can check that if the denominator of b is 3 or 5, then there are no possible values of a. If b = 1/2, then a = 0 for either equation. If b = 3/2, then a = 1 for either equation. Finally, if b is in {1/4, 3/4, 5/4, 7/4}, then there is exactly one solution for a for the equation a + b - 1/2 = 2*k, and one solution for a for the equation a - b + 1/2 = 2*k'. Furthermore, if a + b - 1/2 = 2*k and a - b + 1/2 = 2*k', then subtracting these equations, we get 2*b - 1 = 2*k - 2*k', so b = k - k' + 1/2. Thus, b = 1/2 or b = 3/2, and we count these values just once. This gives ten pairs (a, b).\n\nSimilarly, if cos(a*pi) = -sin(b*pi), then cos(a*pi) = -sin(b*pi) = sin(-b*pi) = cos(pi/2 + b*pi). This implies a*pi - (pi/2 + b*pi) = 2*pi*k or a*pi + (pi/2 + b*pi) = 2*pi*k' for some integers k and k'. These lead to a - b - 1/2 = 2*k or a + b + 1/2 = 2*k'. We have already counted the pairs where b = 0 or b = 1, so we exclude these values.\n\nIf b = 1/2, then a = 1 for either equation. If b = 3/2, then a = 0 for either equation. Finally, if b is in {1/4, 3/4, 5/4, 7/4}, then there is exactly one solution for a for the equation a - b - 1/2 = 2*k, and one solution for a for the equation a + b + 1/2 = 2*k'. Furthermore, if a - b - 1/2 = 2*k and a + b + 1/2 = 2*k', then subtracting these equations, we get 2*b + 1 = 2*k' - 2*k, so b = k' - k - 1/2. Thus, b = 1/2 or b = 3/2, and we count these values just once. We can also confirm that all of the pairs in this case are different from the pairs in the previous case. This gives ten pairs (a, b).\n\nThus, there are a total of 40 + 36 + 10 + 10 = 96 possible pairs (a, b). There are 20*20 = 400 ways to choose the pair (a, b), which gives us a probability of 96/400 = 6/25. \n\nThe answer is 6/25."

Let c be the smallest number such that for every positive integer n, the product of the first n terms satisfies the inequality, absolute value of a0 times a1 times and so on times an-1 is less than or equal to c divided by 2 to the power of n. What is the value of 100 times c, rounded to the nearest integer?",
        "answer": "The sequence is defined as theta sub 0 equals arccos 5 over 13, and theta sub n equals 2 times theta sub n minus 1. \nWe know that cos theta sub 0 equals 5 over 13, and cos theta sub n equals 2 times cos squared theta sub n minus 1 minus 1. \nSince the sequences a sub n and cos theta sub n have the same initial term and recursion, they are the same. \nWe also know that sin squared theta sub 0 equals 1 minus cos squared theta sub 0, which equals 144 over 169. \nSince theta sub 0 is acute, sin theta sub 0 equals 12 over 13. \nNow, a sub 0 times a sub 1 times dots times a sub n minus 1 equals cos theta sub 0 times cos theta sub 1 times dots times cos theta sub n minus 1. \nMultiplying both sides by sin theta sub 0 equals 12 over 13, we get 12 over 13 times a sub 0 times a sub 1 times dots times a sub n minus 1 equals sin theta sub 0 times cos theta sub 0 times cos 2 times theta sub 0 times cos 4 times theta sub 0 times dots times cos 2 to the power n minus 1 times theta sub 0. \nThis expression can be simplified to 1 over 2 to the power n times sin 2 to the power n times theta sub 0. \nHence, the absolute value of a sub 0 times a sub 1 times dots times a sub n minus 1 equals 1 over 2 to the power n times 13 over 12 times the absolute value of sin 2 to the power n times theta sub 0, which is less than or equal to 1 over 2 to the power n times 13 over 12. \nThis implies that c is less than or equal to 13 over 12. \nWe can compute that a sub 1 equals 2 times a sub 0 squared minus 1, which equals 2 times 5 over 13 squared minus 1, which equals minus 119 over 169. \nSo, 5 over 13 times 119 over 169 is less than or equal to c over 4. \nThen c is greater than or equal to 2380 over 2197. \nThe bound 2380 over 2197 is less than or equal to c, which is less than or equal to 13 over 12, tells us that the integer closest to 100 times c is 108. \n\nThe final answer is 108."

        "answer": "The problem can be solved as follows:\n\nGiven that v is a unit vector, we know that the sum of the squares of its components is equal to 1. This can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1.\n\nWe are also given that the angle between v and the vector (2, 2, -1) is 45 degrees. Using the formula for the dot product, we can write this as (2x + 2y - z) / sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2) = cos(45 degrees) = 1 / sqrt(2). Simplifying this equation gives us 2x + 2y - z = 3 / sqrt(2).\n\nWe are also given that the angle between v and the vector (0, 1, -1) is 60 degrees. Using the formula for the dot product, we can write this as (y - z) / sqrt(0^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2) = cos(60 degrees) = 1/2. Simplifying this equation gives us y - z = sqrt(2) / 2.\n\nFrom the equation y - z = sqrt(2) / 2, we can write y as z + sqrt(2) / 2.\n\nSubstituting this expression for y into the equation 2x + 2y - z = 3 / sqrt(2), we get x = -y + z/2 + 3 / (2 * sqrt(2)). Substituting y = z + sqrt(2) / 2, we get x = -(z + sqrt(2) / 2) + z/2 + 3 / (2 * sqrt(2)).\n\nSimplifying this expression for x gives us x = -z/2 + 1 / (2 * sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, substituting the expressions for x and y into the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, we get (-z/2 + 1 / (2 * sqrt(2)))^2 + (z + sqrt(2) / 2)^2 + z^2 = 1.\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation gives us 6z^2 + 2z * sqrt(2) - 1 = 0.\n\nSolving this quadratic equation gives us two possible values for z: z = 1 / (3 * sqrt(2)) and z = -1 / sqrt(2).\n\nNow, substituting these values of z back into the expressions for x and y, we get two possible vectors v: \n(1 / (3 * sqrt(2)), 4 / (3 * sqrt(2)), 1 / (3 * sqrt(2))) and \n(1 / sqrt(2), 0, -1 / sqrt(2)).\n\nFinally, calculating the distance between these two vectors gives us the answer: sqrt(2). \n\nThe answer is sqrt(2)."

Thus, we are looking for a value of k such that k squared plus 36 is a multiple of 180. This can be rewritten as k squared equals 180 times a nonnegative integer n, minus 36, which simplifies to k squared equals 36 times 5n minus 1. Therefore, k must be a multiple of 6. We can test different multiples of 6 to find the smallest values of k that satisfy the equation.

Find the equation of plane P in the form Ax + By + Cz + D = 0, where A, B, C, D are integers such that A is greater than 0 and the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of A, B, C, D is 1.",
        "answer": "We can write the equations of the planes as x + 2y + 3z - 2 = 0 and x - y + z - 3 = 0. Any point in L satisfies both equations, which means any point in L satisfies an equation of the form a(x + 2y + 3z - 2) + b(x - y + z - 3) = 0. We can write this as (a + b)x + (2a - b)y + (3a + b)z - (2a + 3b) = 0. The distance from this plane to (3,1,-1) is 2 divided by the square root of 3. Using the formula for the distance from a point to a plane, we get the absolute value of (a + b)(3) + (2a - b)(1) + (3a + b)(-1) - (2a + 3b) divided by the square root of (a + b)^2 + (2a - b)^2 + (3a + b)^2 = 2 divided by the square root of 3. We can simplify this to the absolute value of 2b divided by the square root of 14a^2 + 4ab + 3b^2 = 2 divided by the square root of 3. Then the absolute value of b times the square root of 3 = the square root of 14a^2 + 4ab + 3b^2. Squaring both sides, we get 3b^2 = 14a^2 + 4ab + 3b^2, so 14a^2 + 4ab = 0. This factors as 2a(7a + 2b) = 0. If a = 0, then plane P will coincide with the second plane x - y + z = 3. So, 7a + 2b = 0.

Since A + B = 180 degrees and 0 < A + B < 180 degrees, we must have A + B = 90 degrees. \n\nThis means A is less than 90 degrees and B is less than 90 degrees, so 2A - B is less than 180 degrees and 2A - B is greater than -90 degrees. Hence, 2A - B = 0 degrees. \n\nSolving the equations A + B = 90 degrees and 2A = B, we find A = 30 degrees and B = 60 degrees.

Therefore, we have the equation: tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C.\n\nWe are also given that cot A cot C = 1/2 and cot B cot C = 1/18. From these, we can derive the expressions: tan A tan C = 2 and tan B tan C = 18.\n\nLet's denote tan C as x. Then we have the expressions: tan A = 2/x and tan B = 18/x.

Then the absolute value of a is equal to the absolute value of omega plus omega bar, which is less than or equal to the absolute value of omega plus the absolute value of omega bar, which equals 2, and b equals omega times omega bar, which equals the absolute value of omega squared, which equals 1.\n\nSo we only need to check the quadratic equations of the form z squared plus az plus 1, where a is between -2 and 2. This gives us the following eight roots of unity: 1, -1, i, -i, one half plus the square root of three over two i, one half minus the square root of three over two i, minus one half plus the square root of three over two i, and minus one half minus the square root of three over two i."

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to start by drawing the altitudes BE and CF. \n\nNext, we can use the fact that in right triangle AFC, AF = b * cos(A), where b is the length of side AC. \n\nUsing the Extended Law of Sines, we know that b = 2R * sin(B), where R is the radius of the circumcircle. \n\nSo, AF = 2R * cos(A) * sin(B). \n\nFrom right triangle ADB, we can find that angle DAB = 90 - B.

In the equation x = (2 * (sin t - 1)) / (2 - cos t), we can solve for sin t to get sin t = (1/2) * x * (2 - cos t) + 1 = (1/2) * x * (2 - (2y + 15) / (y + 3)) + 1 = 1 - (9x) / (2 * (y + 3)). Since cos^2 t + sin^2 t = 1, ((2y + 15) / (y + 3))^2 + (1 - (9x) / (2 * (y + 3)))^2 = 1. Multiplying both sides by (2 * (y + 3))^2 and expanding, it will simplify to 81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0. Therefore, the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients A, B, C, D, E, and F is 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = 1381. The answer is 1381."

        "answer": "Note that the magnitude of the vector is 3. Furthermore, if this vector makes an angle of theta with the positive x-axis, then cos theta is 1/3. This tells us that theta is acute, so the vector passes through the positive x-axis at (3,0,0).\n\nLet the resulting vector be (x,y,z). By symmetry, y = z. Also, since the magnitude of the vector is preserved, x^2 + 2y^2 = 9. Also, since the vector is rotated by 90 degrees, the resulting vector is orthogonal to the original vector. Thus, x + 4y = 0. Then x = -4y. Substituting into x^2 + 2y^2 = 9, we get 16y^2 + 2y^2 = 9, so y^2 = 1/2. Hence, y = \u00b1 1/\u221a2, so x = -4y = \u2213 2\u221a2. From the geometry of the diagram, x is positive and y and z are negative, so x = 2\u221a2. Then y = z = -1/\u221a2, so the resulting vector is (2\u221a2, -1/\u221a2, -1/\u221a2). \n\nThe answer is (2\u221a2, -1/\u221a2, -1/\u221a2)."

We solve these equations to find possible values of k.\n\nThe first equation gives us (k - 1)x = 8y. If x is 0, then y must also be 0. But since the vector v is not zero, x cannot be 0. Similarly, from the second equation, if y is 0, then x must also be 0, which is not possible. \n\nAlso, k cannot be 1 because that would mean y is 0, and hence x is also 0, which is not allowed.

        "answer": "The problem is to find the volume of the region defined by the equation f(x,y,z) = |x + y + z| + |x + y - z| + |x - y + z| + |-x + y + z|, where f(x,y,z) is less than or equal to 4.\n\nFirst, we note that the function f(x,y,z) is symmetric with respect to the xy, xz, and yz planes. This means that if we find the volume of the region in one octant, we can multiply it by 8 to find the total volume.\n\nWe restrict our attention to the octant where x, y, and z are all nonnegative. In this octant, we can assume that x is the largest of x, y, and z.\n\nUsing the triangle inequality, we can show that f(x,y,z) is greater than or equal to 4x. Since f(x,y,z) is less than or equal to 4, we know that x must be less than or equal to 1.\n\nWe can also show that f(x,y,z) is greater than or equal to 2x + 2y + 2z. This means that x + y + z must be less than or equal to 2.\n\nThe region defined by 0 less than or equal to x, y, z less than or equal to 1 is a cube. The equation x + y + z = 2 corresponds to a plane that passes through the points (0,1,1), (1,0,1), and (1,1,0).\n\nTo find the volume of the region, we need to cut off the pyramid whose vertices are (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), and (1,1,1). This pyramid has a volume of 1/6.\n\nThe remaining volume is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. Since we are only looking at one octant, the total volume of the region is 8 times 5/6, which is 20/3.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the region is 20/3."

But we can also take advantage of the fact that a = (1, 1, 1), b = (2, -3, 1), and c = (4, 1, -5) are mutually orthogonal.\n\nWe can take the equation, (-4, 7, 3) = p a + q b + r c, and take the dot product of a with both sides: \na dot (-4, 7, 3) = p a dot a + q a dot b + r a dot c. \nNote that a dot b = a dot c = 0, and we are left with 6 = 3 p. \nHence, p = 2.\n\nIn the same way, we can find q = -13/7 and r = -4/7, so (p, q, r) = (2, -13/7, -4/7). \n\nThe answer is (2, -13/7, -4/7)."

This means the two lines cannot intersect.\n\nFor two lines to be coplanar, if they cannot intersect, the only other possibility is that they are parallel. For the two lines to be parallel, their direction vectors must be proportional. The direction vectors of the lines are (1, -k, k) and (1/2, 1, -1) respectively.

Letting x equals cos theta, we get \nx cubed plus x squared minus one equals zero. \nLet f of x equals x cubed plus x squared minus one. Clearly, x equals minus one is not a root. If minus one is less than x which is less than or equal to zero, then x squared plus x cubed is less than or equal to x squared which is less than one, so \nf of x equals x cubed plus x squared minus one is less than zero. \nThe function f of x is increasing for zero is less than or equal to x which is less than or equal to one.

This allows us to factor as follows: \nz^6 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + 1 = z(z^5 - 1) + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = z(z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = (z^2 - z + 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1).\nThe roots of z^2 - z + 1 = 0 are z = (1 \u00b1 i\u221a3)/2, which are cis 60 degrees and cis 300 degrees.\nNote that (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = z^5 - 1, so the roots of z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 are all the fifth roots of unity, except for 1.

        "answer": "We can start by expressing sin B sin C in terms of cosines. This results in the expression being equal to 1/2 times the difference between cos (B - C) and cos (B + C). \n\nBy using the fact that B + C = 180 degrees - A, we can rewrite this as 1/2 times the sum of cos (B - C) and cos A. \n\nThen, we can add sin A to both sides of the equation to get sin A + sin B sin C = sin A + 1/2 cos A + 1/2 cos (B - C). \n\nNext, we can factor out a common term to simplify the expression. This gives us the equation sin A + sin B sin C = sqrt (5) / 2 times a linear combination of sin A and cos A, plus 1/2 cos (B - C). \n\nBy recognizing that the linear combination of sin A and cos A represents a sine function with a phase shift, we can rewrite the expression as sqrt (5) / 2 times sin (A + theta), where theta is an acute angle, plus 1/2 cos (B - C). \n\nSince both sin (A + theta) and cos (B - C) have maximum values of 1, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when both terms are maximized. \n\nThis occurs when sin (A + theta) = 1 and cos (B - C) = 1. \n\nSubstituting these values back into the expression, we get the maximum value as sqrt (5) / 2 + 1/2 = (1 + sqrt (5)) / 2. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value is (1 + sqrt (5)) / 2.

        "question": "How many complex numbers z such that the absolute value of z is less than 30 satisfy the equation e to the power of z equals the fraction z minus 1 over z plus 1?",
        "answer": "The correct answer is: The total number of roots is 10. \n\nLet's break it down. \n\nWe have a complex number z = x + yi, where x and y are real. We are given the equation e^z = (z - 1) / (z + 1). \n\nFirst, we consider the absolute value of e^z. We can rewrite e^z as e^(x + yi) = e^x * e^(iy). The absolute value of e^(iy) is 1, so the absolute value of e^z is e^x. \n\nThis means that e^z is inside the unit circle if x is less than 0, is on the unit circle if x is equal to 0, and is outside the unit circle if x is greater than 0.\n\nWe also note that z is closer to -1 than to 1 if x is less than 0, is equidistant to 1 and -1 if x is equal to 0, and is closer to 1 than to -1 if x is greater than 0. So, (z - 1) / (z + 1) is outside the unit circle or undefined if x is less than 0, is on the unit circle if x is equal to 0, and is inside the unit circle if x is greater than 0.\n\nBy comparing these two results, we can see that if e^z = (z - 1) / (z + 1), then x must be equal to 0. This means that z is a purely imaginary number, yi.\n\nAlso, note that z satisfies the original equation if and only if -z does. So, we will first assume that y is positive and then double the number of roots to account for negative y. \n\nSubstituting z = yi into the equation e^z = (z - 1) / (z + 1) gives the new equation e^(iy) = (iy - 1) / (iy + 1). \n\nBoth sides of the equation are always on the unit circle. The only thing we don't know is when the two sides are at the same point on the unit circle.\n\nGiven a nonzero complex number w, the angle of w is the angle in the interval [0, 2\u03c0) that the segment from 0 to w makes with the positive x-axis.\n\nAs y increases from 0 to infinity, the angle of iy - 1 strictly decreases from \u03c0 to \u03c0/2, while the angle of iy + 1 strictly increases from 0 to \u03c0/2. So, the angle of (iy - 1) / (iy + 1) strictly decreases from \u03c0 to 0.\n\nLet's consider y in the interval from 2n\u03c0 to (2n + 2)\u03c0. As y increases from 2n\u03c0 to (2n + 1)\u03c0, the angle of e^(iy) strictly increases from 0 to \u03c0. As y increases from (2n + 1)\u03c0 to just under (2n + 2)\u03c0, the angle of e^(iy) strictly increases from \u03c0 to just under 2\u03c0.\n\nComparing the angle information for (iy - 1) / (iy + 1) and e^(iy), we can see that (iy - 1) / (iy + 1) and e^(iy) are equal for exactly one y in (2n\u03c0, (2n + 1)\u03c0), and for no y in [(2n + 1)\u03c0, (2n + 2)\u03c0].\n\nSo, we have exactly one root of y in each of (0, \u03c0), (2\u03c0, 3\u03c0), (4\u03c0, 5\u03c0), (6\u03c0, 7\u03c0), and (8\u03c0, 9\u03c0). That gives 5 positive roots for y.\n\nBecause we have 5 positive roots for y, by symmetry we have 5 negative roots for y. Altogether, the total number of roots is 10."

The dot product of (0, 4) and (1, 3) is 12, and the dot product of (1, 3) with itself is 10. So, p = (12/10) * (1, 3) = (6/5, 18/5).\n\nWe are also given that p = ((0, 4) + r) / 2. Rearranging this equation, we get r = 2p - (0, 4). Substituting the value of p, we get r = 2 * (6/5, 18/5) - (0, 4) = (12/5, 36/5) - (0, 4) = (12/5, 36/5 - 20/5) = (12/5, 16/5).\n\nTherefore, the reflection r is (12/5, 16/5)."

Substituting these values into the given equation, we get an equation in terms of x and y.\n\nAfter simplifying, we get x^2 * y^2 = 9. This means that the possible values of xy are 3 and -3. For example, if a = b = 2\u03c0/3, then xy = 3. If a = 2\u03c0/3 and b = 4\u03c0/3, then xy = -3.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of xy are 3 and -3."

        "answer": "The solutions of the equation are the 1997th roots of unity and are equal to cos(2\u03c0k/1997) + isin(2\u03c0k/1997) for k = 0, 1, ..., 1996. They are also located at the vertices of a regular 1997-gon that is centered at the origin in the complex plane.\n\nBy rotating around the origin, we can assume that v = 1. Then the absolute value of v + w squared is equal to the absolute value of cos(2\u03c0k/1997) + isin(2\u03c0k/1997) + 1 squared. This is equal to the absolute value of cos(2\u03c0k/1997) + 1 + isin(2\u03c0k/1997) squared.\n\nExpanding this, we get cos^2(2\u03c0k/1997) + 2cos(2\u03c0k/1997) + 1 + sin^2(2\u03c0k/1997). Using the identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we can simplify this to 2 + 2cos(2\u03c0k/1997).\n\nWe want the absolute value of v + w squared to be greater than or equal to 2 + \u221a3. This is equivalent to cos(2\u03c0k/1997) being greater than or equal to \u221a3/2. This occurs when \u03c0/6 is greater than or equal to 2\u03c0k/1997, which is greater than or equal to -\u03c0/6.\n\nSolving for k, we get k = 166, 165, ..., -165, -166. There are 332 values of k that satisfy this condition. Since there are 1996 possible values of k, the desired probability is 332/1996, which simplifies to 83/499.\n\nThe answer is 83/499."

What is the area of triangle ABC?",
        "answer": "Let angle DBE be alpha and angle DBC be beta. Then angle CBE is alpha minus beta and angle ABE is alpha plus beta, so tan of alpha minus beta times tan of alpha plus beta equals tan squared of alpha. Thus, the expression for tan of alpha minus beta times tan of alpha plus beta simplifies to tan squared of alpha. It follows that tan squared of alpha minus tan squared of beta equals tan squared of alpha times one minus tan squared of alpha times tan squared of beta. Upon simplifying, tan squared of beta times tan to the power of four of alpha minus one equals zero, so tan of alpha equals one and alpha equals pi divided by four.\n\nLet DC be a and BD be b. Then cot of angle DBC equals b divided by a. Because angle CBE equals pi divided by four minus beta and angle ABE equals pi divided by four plus beta, it follows that cot of angle CBE equals tan of angle ABE equals tan of pi divided by four plus beta equals one plus a divided by b divided by one minus a divided by b equals b plus a divided by b minus a. Thus, the numbers one, b plus a divided by b minus a, and b divided by a form an arithmetic progression, so b divided by a equals b plus three a divided by b minus a. Setting b equals k times a yields k squared minus two k minus three equals zero, and the only positive solution is k equals three.\n\nHence, b equals BE divided by square root of two equals five square root of two, a equals five square root of two divided by three, and the area of triangle ABC is ab equals fifty divided by three. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{50/3}$"

If cos of x divided by 2 equals 1 divided by 2, then x equals negative 2 pi divided by 3 or x equals 2 pi divided by 3.\n\nWe check that all these values work, so the solutions are -2 pi divided by 3, 0, and 2 pi divided by 3."

We can start by finding the lengths of AP and AQ, which are the segments from point A to lines PQ and RS, respectively. \n\nSince line PQ bisects the perimeter of the triangle, we know that AP + AQ = (7 + 8 + 9)/2 = 12. We also know that the area of triangle APQ is half the area of triangle ABC, so we can set up an equation using the formula for the area of a triangle. \n\nAfter finding the lengths of AP and AQ, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the cosine and sine of angle A. Then, we can find the tangent of angle AQP and the tangent of angle CRS. \n\nFinally, we can use the tangent addition formula to find the tangent of the angle between lines PQ and RS, which is equal to theta.

We have tan 2x = sec 3x - tan 3x, which can be further simplified to tan 2x = 1/cos 3x - sin 3x/cos 3x, and finally to tan 2x = (1 - sin 3x)/cos 3x.\n\nNow, recall the identity for tan theta/2, which is (1 - cos theta)/sin theta. By comparing this with our expression for tan 2x, we can rewrite (1 - sin 3x)/cos 3x as (1 - cos(pi/2 - 3x))/(sin(pi/2 - 3x)).\n\nThis expression is equivalent to tan(pi/4 - 3x/2), therefore, we have tan 2x = tan(pi/4 - 3x/2). Since the tangent function has a period of pi, we can set 2x - (pi/4 - 3x/2) = n*pi, where n is an integer.\n\nSolving this equation for x, we find x = (4n + 1)*pi/14.

The vector being projected onto has a direction vector with components cosine of theta and sine of theta. The determinant of this matrix is calculated as the product of the top left and bottom right elements minus the product of the top right and bottom left elements, which results in the square of the cosine of theta times the square of the sine of theta minus the square of the product of the cosine and sine of theta, and this equals zero. This makes sense geometrically because a projection matrix projects a vector onto a line, and the determinant of the matrix represents the scaling factor of the projection, which is zero because the projected vector has no component perpendicular to the line of projection, resulting in a loss of one dimension and a determinant of zero.

So, we calculate the dot product: (2, 3, 6) \u00b7 (-10, -2, 11) = 2(-10) + 3(-2) + 6(11) = -20 - 6 + 66 = 40.\n\nThe magnitude of d is \u221a(2^2 + 3^2 + 6^2) = \u221a(4 + 9 + 36) = \u221a49 = 7.

Using the tangent addition formula, this is equal to 1 minus the product of the tangents of the arctangents of a and b, divided by the sum of the tangents of the arctangents of a and b.\n\nSince the tangent of the arctangent of a is equal to a, and the tangent of the arctangent of b is equal to b, we can substitute these values into the formula.

This gives us the equation (z - u) / (v - u) = (conjugate of z - conjugate of u) / (conjugate of v - conjugate of u).\n\nSubstituting the values of u and v into the equation, we get (z + 2 - 3i) / (3 - 2i) = (conjugate of z + 2 + 3i) / (3 + 2i).\n\nCross-multiplying the equation, we have (3 + 2i)(z + 2 - 3i) = (3 - 2i)(conjugate of z + 2 + 3i). \n\nThis simplifies to (3 + 2i)z + (-3 + 2i) = 10i.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by -i, we get (2 - 3i)z + (2 + 3i)(conjugate of z) = 10.\n\nHence, we can conclude that a = 2 - 3i and b = 2 + 3i, so ab = (2 - 3i)(2 + 3i) = 13.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve the problem by substituting the given values of z into the equation and solving for a and b.\n\nSubstituting z = -2 + 3i and z = 1 + i into the given equation, we get two equations: (-2 + 3i)a + (-2 - 3i)b = 10 and (1 + i)a + (1 - i)b = 10.\n\nSubtracting these equations, we get (3 - 2i)a + (3 + 2i)b = 0. \n\nSo, b = -(3 - 2i)/(3 + 2i)a.\n\nSubstituting b into the first equation, we have (-2 + 3i)a - (-2 - 3i)(3 - 2i)/(3 + 2i)a = 10.\n\nSolving for a, we find a = 2 - 3i. Then b = 2 + 3i, so ab = (2 - 3i)(2 + 3i) = 13.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 13."

        "answer": "Since M is the midpoint of BC, we have the area of triangle ABM equal to the area of triangle ACM. Also, since ADM is the reflection of AEM over AM, we have the area of triangle ADM equal to the area of triangle AEM, and AD is equal to AE, which is 6. Similarly, we have the area of triangle C'DM equal to the area of triangle CEM, and C'D is equal to CE, which is 12.\n\nGiven that the area of ABM is equal to the area of ACM and the area of ADM is equal to the area of AEM, we can subtract the area of ADM from the area of ABM and the area of AEM from the area of ACM. This results in the area of ABD being equal to the area of CEM. Combining this with the fact that the area of CEM is equal to the area of C'DM gives us the area of ABD equal to the area of C'DM.\n\nTherefore, we can set up an equation using the formula for the area of a triangle: 0.5 * base * height * sin(angle). Since the angle ADB is equal to the angle C'DM, we can equate the two expressions and solve for DM. By substituting the known values of AD, DB, C'D, and the angle, we can find that DM is equal to 5.\n\nNow, to find the length of AB, we apply the Law of Cosines to triangle ADB. We have AB squared equal to AD squared plus DB squared minus 2 * AD * DB * cos(angle ADB). We know that cos(angle ADB) is equal to cos(angle C'DM) since the two angles are equal. \n\nUsing the Law of Cosines on triangle C'DM, we can find the value of cos(angle C'DM) and substitute it back into the equation for AB. By calculating the values, we find that AB squared is equal to 192. Therefore, the length of AB is the square root of 192, which simplifies to 8 times the square root of 3. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8\\sqrt{3}}$"

Furthermore, negative pi over 2 is less than or equal to the inverse sine of x, which is less than or equal to pi over 2, so 0 is less than or equal to pi over 2 minus the inverse sine of x, which is less than or equal to pi.

Therefore, the solutions to the equation x^4 - x^3 - x - 1 = 0 are given by the solutions to the equation x^2 - x - 1 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we can solve this equation to get x = (1 \u00b1 \u221a5) / 2. However, if x = (1 - \u221a5) / 2, then x is negative. Since the given equation involves the arctangent function, which is only defined for positive real numbers, we discard this solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the given equation is x = (1 + \u221a5) / 2."

From right triangle DPQ, we have tan of angle DPQ equals 8 over x.\n\nThen, tan of angle APD equals tan of angle APQ plus angle DPQ, which equals the sum of tan of angle APQ and tan of angle DPQ, divided by 1 minus the product of tan of angle APQ and tan of angle DPQ.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get tan of angle APD equals the sum of 16 over x and 8 over x, divided by 1 minus the product of 16 over x and 8 over x. Simplifying, we get 24x over x squared minus 128, which equals 3.\n\nSolving for x, we get x squared minus 128 equals 8x, or x squared minus 8x minus 128 equals 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get x minus 16, times x plus 8, equals 0. Therefore, x equals 16 or x equals negative 8.\n\nSince x represents a length, it cannot be negative.

        "answer": "By the Law of Sines, we have 27 divided by sin A equals 48 divided by sin 3A. Then sin 3A divided by sin A equals 48 divided by 27, or 3 minus 4 sin squared A equals 16 divided by 9. Hence, sin squared A equals 11 divided by 36, so sin A equals the square root of 11 divided by 6. Also, cos squared A equals 1 minus 11 divided by 36, which equals 25 divided by 36. Since A equals C divided by 3 is less than 60 degrees, cos A equals 5 divided by 6.\n\nThen again by the Law of Sines, we have b divided by sin B equals a divided by sin A, so b equals a sin B divided by sin A, which equals 27 sin 4A divided by sin A. This equals 27 times 2 sin 2A cos 2A divided by sin A, which equals 27 times 2 times 2 sin A cos A times 2 cos squared A minus 1, divided by sin A.\n\nThis simplifies to 27 times 2 times 2 cos A times 2 cos squared A minus 1, which equals 27 times 2 times 2 times 5 divided by 6 times 2 times 25 divided by 36 minus 1.

        "answer": "The minimum distance between the two lines can be found by first writing the points P and Q in terms of their respective parameters t and s. For the first line, we can write P as (2t + 3, -2t - 1, t + 2). For the second line, we can write Q as (s, 2s, -s + 4).\n\nThen we calculate the square of the distance PQ, which is given by the sum of the squares of the differences between the corresponding coordinates of P and Q. This yields an expression in terms of t and s, which can be simplified and rewritten in a form that reveals a perfect square.\n\nBy completing the square, we find that the expression for PQ squared can be written as the sum of two squares, one of which is a perfect square of the form (s + 3t + 2) squared, and the other of which is 5 times the square of (s - 1). This tells us that PQ squared is greater than or equal to 5, with equality occurring when both s + 3t + 2 and s - 1 are equal to zero.\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously yields the values s = 1 and t = -1, which correspond to the minimum value of PQ.

The vertices of the cut form a parallelogram, with its center located at the origin and a z-coordinate of 25 divided by 4.\n\nThe area of the triangle formed by two of the vertices and the center of the parallelogram can be calculated using the cross product of two vectors. The cross product is equal to a vector with specific components, and the magnitude of this vector is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.\n\nThe area of the triangle is half of the magnitude of the cross product, and it is equal to 225 divided by 4.

The center of the sphere is at point O = (0, 0, 1), and point P is at (0, -1, 2). Point X is on the boundary of the shadow and is represented by (x, y, 0). Since X is on the boundary, line PX is tangent to the sphere, and we denote the point of tangency as T.\n\nGiven that angle PTO is 90 degrees, we can use the fact that OP and OT are fixed, so angle OPT is equal to angle OPX and is constant for all points X on the boundary.

Since negative 19 divided by pi is approximately negative 6 point 0 5 and 98 divided by pi is approximately 31 point 1 9, the possible values of k are negative 6, negative 5, and so on up to 31, giving us a total of 31 minus negative 6 plus 1 equals 38 solutions."

From the first equation, we can express t as three x plus one, all divided by eleven.

        "question": "Let a and b be angles such that cos(a + b) = cos a + cos b. Find the maximum value of cos a.",
        "answer": "The problem statement is given, and the solution is presented step by step. From the equation cos(a + b) = cos a + cos b, we can express cos a as cos a = cos(a + b) - cos b. Using the sum-to-product identity, we have cos(a + b) - cos b = -2 sin((a + 2b)/2) sin(a/2). Let k = sin((a + 2b)/2), so cos a = -2k sin(a/2).\n\nThen, we can express cos^2 a in terms of k and sin(a/2), which gives cos^2 a = 4k^2 sin^2(a/2) = 4k^2 * (1/2) * (1 - cos a) = 2k^2 * (1 - cos a). Rearranging this equation, we get cos^2 a / (1 - cos a) = 2k^2, which is less than or equal to 2. \n\nThis leads to the inequality cos^2 a + 2 cos a + 1 \u2264 3. Simplifying this, we have (cos a + 1)^2 \u2264 3, which gives cos a + 1 \u2264 \u221a3, or cos a \u2264 \u221a3 - 1. \n\nTo achieve equality, we can choose a = arccos(\u221a3 - 1) and b = (3\u03c0 - a)/2, making k = sin((a + 2b)/2) = -1. Therefore, the maximum value of cos a is \u221a3 - 1. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$"

        "answer": "The equation is given as z^8 - z^6 + z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0. By multiplying both sides by (z^2 + 1), we get (z^2 + 1)(z^8 - z^6 + z^4 - z^2 + 1) = z^10 + 1 = 0. This implies that z^10 = -1, which can be expressed as cis 180 degrees. Therefore, z = 18 degrees + 360 degrees * k / 10 = 18 degrees + 36 degrees * k, where k is an integer. Since z^2 is not equal to -1, the roots of z are graphed and labeled. The roots with the maximum imaginary part are cis 54 degrees and cis 126 degrees. Hence, the value of theta is 54 degrees."

        "answer": "The side length of the regular tetrahedron is the distance between the points (0,1,2) and (4,2,1), which is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in their coordinates. This gives us a side length of sqrt(18), which simplifies to 3 sqrt(2).\n\nTo find the fourth vertex of the tetrahedron, we use the fact that it has integer coordinates (x,y,z). Using the distance formula, we can set up three equations based on the distances between the fourth vertex and the other three vertices. These equations are:\n\nx^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-2)^2 = 18\n(x-4)^2 + (y-2)^2 + (z-1)^2 = 18\n(x-3)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-5)^2 = 18\n\nBy subtracting the first and third equations, we get 6x + 6z - 30 = 0, which simplifies to x + z = 5. This means z = 5 - x.\n\nSubtracting the first and second equations gives us 8x + 2y - 2z - 16 = 0. Rearranging this equation, we find y = z - 4x + 8. Substituting z = 5 - x, we get y = (5 - x) - 4x + 8, which simplifies to y = 13 - 5x.\n\nSubstituting y and z into the first equation, we get x^2 + (12 - 5x)^2 + (3 - x)^2 = 18. Expanding and simplifying, we get 27x^2 - 126x + 135 = 0. Factoring this quadratic equation, we get 9(x - 3)(3x - 5) = 0.\n\nSince x must be an integer, we find x = 3. Then, substituting x into the equations for y and z, we get y = -2 and z = 2.\n\nTherefore, the fourth vertex of the tetrahedron is (3, -2, 2)."

        "answer": "First, we claim that the inverse cosine of x plus the inverse sine of x equals pi over 2 for all x in the interval -1 to 1.\n\nNote that the cosine of pi over 2 minus the inverse sine of x is equal to the cosine of the inverse cosine of x, which is x. Furthermore, the inverse sine of x is between -pi over 2 and pi over 2, so pi over 2 minus the inverse sine of x is between 0 and pi.\n\nTherefore, pi over 2 minus the inverse sine of x is equal to the inverse cosine of x, so the inverse cosine of x plus the inverse sine of x equals pi over 2.\n\nIn particular, we have the function f of x, which is equal to the square of the inverse cosine of x over 2, plus pi times the inverse sine of x over 2, minus the square of the inverse sine of x over 2, plus pi squared over 12 times the quantity x squared plus 6x plus 8.\n\nWe simplify this expression by using the identity we proved earlier. We can rewrite f of x as the square of the inverse cosine of x over 2, minus the square of the inverse sine of x over 2, plus pi times the inverse sine of x over 2, plus pi squared over 12 times the quantity x squared plus 6x plus 8.\n\nThis can be factored into the quantity the inverse cosine of x over 2 plus the inverse sine of x over 2, times the quantity the inverse cosine of x over 2 minus the inverse sine of x over 2, plus pi times the inverse sine of x over 2, plus pi squared over 12 times the quantity x squared plus 6x plus 8.\n\nSince the inverse cosine of x over 2 plus the inverse sine of x over 2 equals pi over 2, we can substitute this into the expression. We get pi over 2 times the inverse cosine of x over 2, minus pi over 2 times the inverse sine of x over 2, plus pi times the inverse sine of x over 2, plus pi squared over 12 times the quantity x squared plus 6x plus 8.\n\nThis simplifies to pi over 2 times the inverse cosine of x over 2, plus pi over 2 times the inverse sine of x over 2, plus pi squared over 12 times the quantity x squared plus 6x plus 8.\n\nUsing the identity we proved earlier again, we know that the inverse cosine of x over 2 plus the inverse sine of x over 2 equals pi over 2. So we can rewrite the expression as pi squared over 4, plus pi squared over 12 times the quantity x squared plus 6x plus 8.\n\nFinally, we can rewrite the quantity x squared plus 6x plus 8 as the quantity x plus 3 squared. So the expression for f of x simplifies to pi squared over 6, plus pi squared over 12 times the quantity x plus 3 squared.\n\nThe function f of x is defined for x between -2 and 2, so the range is between pi squared over 4 and 9 pi squared over 4."

The hypotenuse is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem as the square root of (1^2 + 7^2), which equals 5 times the square root of 2. \n\nFrom this triangle, we determine that the cosine of angle AOC is 1 divided by 5 times the square root of 2, and the sine of angle AOC is 7 divided by 5 times the square root of 2.\n\nNext, we calculate the cosine of angle AOB using the cosine addition formula, which states that the cosine of the sum of two angles is the cosine of the first angle times the cosine of the second angle minus the sine of the first angle times the sine of the second angle. \n\nApplying this formula, we get the cosine of angle AOB as -3/5.\n\nWe then use the vector equation OC = m * OA + n * OB and take the dot product of this equation with OA. This gives us the equation OA dot OC = m * OA dot OA + n * OA dot OB.\n\nFrom this equation, we can derive the relationship 1/5 = m - (3/5) * n, based on the properties of the dot product and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nSimilarly, taking the dot product of the vector equation with OB gives us the equation OB dot OC = m * OA dot OB + n * OB dot OB. \n\nThis leads to the relationship 1 = -(3/5) * m + n, again utilizing the properties of the dot product and vector magnitudes.\n\nTo find the values of m and n, we solve the system of equations 1/5 = m - (3/5) * n and 1 = -(3/5) * m + n.\n\nBy solving this system, we find the solution for m and n to be (5/4, 7/4). \n\nTherefore, the answer is (5/4, 7/4)."

        "answer": "We can write the expression as the fraction with the numerator being cos of half of the difference of A and B, times cos of half of C, minus sin of half of the difference of A and B, times sin of half of C, all divided by sin of half of C, times cos of half of C.\n\nThe numerator simplifies to cos of half of the sum of the difference of A and B, and C, which equals cos of half of the difference of the sum of A and C, and B. Since A plus B plus C equals one hundred eighty degrees, the sum of A and C equals one hundred eighty degrees minus B, so we have cos of half of the difference of one hundred eighty degrees minus B, and B. This simplifies to cos of ninety degrees minus half of B, or sin of half of B.\n\nThe denominator is sin of half of C, times cos of half of C, which equals half of sin of C. \n\nSo the expression equals two times sin of B, divided by sin of C, which by the law of sines, equals two times the length of side AC, divided by the length of side AB. Given that the length of side AC equals ten and the length of side AB equals six, the expression simplifies to ten divided by six, or five thirds.\n\nThe final answer is 5/3."

Let's denote AQ as x. \n\nUsing the Law of Cosines on triangle BCP, we calculate BC squared as 2 squared plus 3 squared minus 2 times 2 times 3 times the cosine of 60 degrees, which equals 7.\n\nThen, using the Law of Cosines on triangle ACQ, we find AC squared as x squared plus 2 squared minus 2 times x times 2 times the cosine of 60 degrees, which simplifies to x squared minus 2x plus 4.\n\nWe also know that AB equals 3 and AR equals 5 minus x. Applying the Law of Cosines on triangle ABR, we calculate AB squared as 3 squared plus the square of 5 minus x, minus 2 times 3 times 5 minus x times the cosine of 60 degrees, resulting in x squared minus 7x plus 19.\n\nFinally, using the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle ABC, we equate BC squared plus AC squared to AB squared. This gives us 7 plus x squared minus 2x plus 4 equals x squared minus 7x plus 19.\n\nSolving this equation, we find that x equals 8 divided by 5, which gives us the final answer: 8/5."

        "answer": "From the given equation, we can start by cross multiplying to get rid of the fractions. This gives us sin 4x times the denominator of the right side equals cos 4x times the numerator of the right side. \n\nExpanding this, we get sin 4x times cos x plus sin x equals cos 4x times cos x minus sin x. Rearranging the terms, we get cos x times sin 4x plus sin x times sin 4x equals cos x times cos 4x minus sin x times cos 4x.\n\nNow, we can apply the sum-to-product identities to both sides of the equation. The left side becomes sin of the sum of 4x and x, which equals sin 5x. The right side becomes cos of the difference between 4x and x, which equals cos 3x, but since we have cos 4x times cos x minus sin x times sin 4x, this is actually cos of the sum of 4x and x, which equals cos 5x.\n\nSo we have sin 5x equals cos 5x.

Since vector v - p is parallel to the normal vector of the plane, it is also parallel to vector (1, -1, 2). \n\nTo find vector v - p, we use the formula for projection, which is (v dot n) / (n dot n) * n, where v is the vector being projected, n is the vector being projected onto, and dot denotes the dot product. \n\nSo, v dot n is (4, 0, 7) dot (1, -1, 2) = 4*1 + 0*(-1) + 7*2 = 18. \nAnd n dot n is (1, -1, 2) dot (1, -1, 2) = 1*1 + (-1)*(-1) + 2*2 = 6. \n\nThus, v - p is (18/6) * (1, -1, 2) = 3 * (1, -1, 2) = (3, -3, 6). \n\nFinally, p = v - (v - p) = (4, 0, 7) - (3, -3, 6) = (1, 3, 1).\n\nThe answer is (1, 3, 1)."

Hence, b = 4d - 3a and c = 3e - 2a.\n\nBy the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have BT/TC = AB/AC = 4/6 = 2/3, so t = (3/5)b + (2/5)c = (3/5)(4d - 3a) + (2/5)(3e - 2a) = (12/5)d + (6/5)e - (13/5)a.\n\nThen t + (13/5)a = (12/5)d + (6/5)e, or (5/18)t + (13/18)a = (12/18)d + (6/18)e.

        "answer": "The equation describes a line, so if v is the vector that is closest to a, then the vector joining v and a is orthogonal to the direction vector of the line. This gives us the equation that the dot product of the vector joining v and a and the direction vector of the line is zero. \n\nExpanding this equation, we have the dot product of the vector joining v and a and the direction vector of the line is equal to zero.

The theorem states that the expression for the cosine and sine of a multiple angle can be found using complex numbers. \n\nUsing this theorem, we can derive expressions for the cosine and sine of n times an angle theta. By matching the real and imaginary parts of these expressions, we can find the individual formulas for the cosine and sine of n times theta. \n\nApplying these formulas, we can derive the expression for the tangent of n times theta in terms of the tangent of theta. \n\nFor the specific case where n equals 7, we can calculate the expression for the tangent of 7 times theta. \n\nGiven that the tangent of 7 times theta equals zero for certain values of theta, such as pi/7, 2pi/7, and 3pi/7, we can use this information to find the roots of the resulting polynomial equation. \n\nThe roots of the polynomial equation are the tangents of pi/7, 2pi/7, and 3pi/7, as well as their negatives. \n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, which relate the roots of a polynomial to its coefficients, we can find the product of the squares of the tangents of these angles. \n\nSince the tangents are positive for acute angles, we can find the product of the tangents of pi/7, 2pi/7, and 3pi/7. \n\nTherefore, the product of the tangents of pi/7, 2pi/7, and 3pi/7 is the square root of 7. \n\nThe answer is sqrt(7)."

Then the cosine of theta equals the square root of 1 minus x squared, so the tangent of theta equals the sine of theta divided by the cosine of theta, which equals x divided by the square root of 1 minus x squared.\n\nThus, the sine of the inverse cosine of the tangent of the inverse sine of x equals the sine of the inverse cosine of x divided by the square root of 1 minus x squared.\n\nLet psi be equal to the inverse cosine of x divided by the square root of 1 minus x squared, so 0 is less than psi and psi is less than pi over 2, and the cosine of psi equals x divided by the square root of 1 minus x squared. Then the sine of psi equals the square root of 1 minus the cosine of psi squared, which equals the square root of 1 minus x squared divided by 1 minus x squared, which equals the square root of 1 minus 2x squared divided by 1 minus x squared, which equals x.\n\nSquaring both sides, we get 1 minus 2x squared divided by 1 minus x squared equals x squared.

The positive solutions are then the square root of 3 plus the square root of 5 divided by 2 and the square root of 3 minus the square root of 5 divided by 2. However, the inverse sine of x is defined only for -1 is less than or equal to x and x is less than or equal to 1, so there is only one positive solution, namely x equals the square root of 3 minus the square root of 5 divided by 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the square root of 3 minus the square root of 5 divided by 2, but since the problem is a yes or no or a specific number that solves the problem, the final answer is the square root of 3 minus the square root of 5 divided by 2, which is approximately 0.62, but the problem wants the number of solutions, so the answer is 1."

Furthermore, the inverse sine of x is between negative pi over 2 and pi over 2, so pi over 2 minus the inverse sine of x is between 0 and pi. \n\nTherefore, pi over 2 minus the inverse sine of x equals the inverse cosine of x, so the inverse cosine of x plus the inverse sine of x equals pi over 2.\n\nLet alpha equal the inverse cosine of x and beta equal the inverse sine of x, so alpha plus beta equals pi over 2.

        "answer": "If zero is less than x and x is less than pi by two, then sine x, cosine x, and tangent x are all positive, so f of x is greater than zero.\n\nFor x equals pi by two, tangent x is not defined.\n\nIf pi by two is less than x and x is less than pi, then sine x is positive, and cosine x and tangent x are negative. Suppose f of x equals zero. Then sine x plus two cosine x equals negative three tangent x, which is greater than zero. Hence, sine x plus cosine x is greater than sine x plus two cosine x, which is greater than zero. Then tangent x cosine x plus cosine x equals cosine x times the quantity tangent x plus one, which is greater than zero, so tangent x plus one is less than zero, which means tangent x is less than negative one. But then f of x equals sine x plus two cosine x plus three tangent x, which is less than one plus two times zero plus three times negative one, which equals negative two, so there are no solutions to f of x equals zero in this case.\n\nNote that f of pi equals negative two and f of five pi by four equals three minus three by the square root of two, which is greater than zero. Therefore, by continuity, f of x equals zero has a root between pi and five pi by four. Since three is less than pi and pi is less than five pi by four, which is less than four, the floor of r equals three. The answer is 3."

        "answer": "We will examine the first term in the expression we want to evaluate, the sine of 2x divided by the sine of 2y, separately from the second term, the cosine of 2x divided by the cosine of 2y. Using the identity that the sine of 2 times theta equals 2 times the sine of theta times the cosine of theta, we have the sine of 2x divided by the sine of 2y equals the sine of x times the cosine of x divided by the sine of y times the cosine of y, which equals the sine of x divided by the sine of y times the cosine of x divided by the cosine of y, which equals 3 times one half, which equals 3 divided by 2.\n\nLet the equation the sine of x divided by the sine of y equals 3 be equation 1, and let the equation the cosine of x divided by the cosine of y equals one half be equation 2. To use the identity the sine of theta squared plus the cosine of theta squared equals 1, we will cross multiply equation 1 by the sine of y and multiply equation 2 by the cosine of y. Equation 1 then becomes the sine of x equals 3 times the sine of y. Equation 2 then becomes the cosine of x equals one half times the cosine of y.\n\nWe can square both of the resulting equations and match up the resulting left-hand side with the resulting right-hand side and get 1 equals 9 times the sine of y squared plus one fourth times the cosine of y squared. Applying the identity the cosine of y squared equals 1 minus the sine of y squared, we can change 1 equals 9 times the sine of y squared plus one fourth times the cosine of y squared into 1 equals 9 times the sine of y squared plus one fourth minus one fourth times the sine of y squared.\n\nRearranging, we get three fourths equals thirty-five fourths times the sine of y squared. Therefore, the sine of y squared equals three thirty-fifths. Squaring equation 1, leading to the sine of x squared equals 9 times the sine of y squared, we can solve for the sine of x squared as follows: the sine of x squared equals 9 times three thirty-fifths, which equals twenty-seven thirty-fifths.\n\nUsing the identity the cosine of 2 times theta equals 1 minus 2 times the sine of theta squared, we can solve for the cosine of 2x divided by the cosine of 2y. The cosine of 2x equals 1 minus 2 times the sine of x squared, which equals 1 minus 2 times twenty-seven thirty-fifths, which equals 1 minus fifty-four thirty-fifths, which equals negative nineteen thirty-fifths. The cosine of 2y equals 1 minus 2 times the sine of y squared, which equals 1 minus 2 times three thirty-fifths, which equals 1 minus six thirty-fifths, which equals twenty-nine thirty-fifths.\n\nHence, the cosine of 2x divided by the cosine of 2y equals negative nineteen thirty-fifths divided by twenty-nine thirty-fifths, which equals negative nineteen twenty-ninths. Finally, the sine of 2x divided by the sine of 2y plus the cosine of 2x divided by the cosine of 2y equals 3 divided by 2 plus negative nineteen twenty-ninths, which equals forty-nine fifty-eighths. \n\nThe answer is 49/58."

This can be further simplified to cos(n pi/2 - nt) + i sin(n pi/2 - nt). \n\nAdditionally, the expression sin nt + i cos nt is equivalent to cos(pi/2 - nt) + i sin(pi/2 - nt).

Similarly, from the equation a^7 b^2 = 1, we can raise both sides to the power of 5 to get a^35 b^10 = 1. Dividing these two equations, we get a^29 = 1. Therefore, a must be a 29th root of unity.\n\nFrom the equation a^7 b^2 = 1, we can raise both sides to the power of 2 to get a^14 b^4 = 1. Hence, by dividing the equation a^3 b^5 = 1 by the equation a^14 b^4 = 1, we get b = a^11.\n\nConversely, if a is a 29th root of unity and b = a^11, then we can check that a^3 b^5 = 1 and a^7 b^2 = 1.

We can start by expanding the norm of the vector sum a + b. \n\nThe squared norm of the vector sum a + b is equal to the dot product of the vector sum a + b with itself. This can be expanded to the dot product of a with a, plus two times the dot product of a and b, plus the dot product of b with b.\n\nSince the dot product of a with a is equal to the squared norm of a, and the dot product of b with b is equal to the squared norm of b, we can write this expression as the squared norm of a plus two times the dot product of a and b, plus the squared norm of b.\n\nGiven that the norms of a, b, and a + b are all equal to d, we can rewrite the expression as d squared equals d squared plus two times the dot product of a and b, plus d squared.\n\nBy simplifying the equation, we get the dot product of a and b equals negative d squared over 2.\n\nThe cosine of the angle between vectors a and b is given by the dot product of a and b, divided by the product of the norms of a and b. Since the norms of a and b are both d, the cosine of the angle is equal to negative d squared over 2, divided by d squared.\n\nThis simplifies to negative one half.

        "answer": "Note that x^7 = cos 2 pi + i sin 2 pi = 1, so x^7 - 1 = 0, which factors as (x - 1)(x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = 0. Since x is not equal to 1, x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0.\n\nWe can then calculate the following expressions: (2x + x^2)(2x^6 + x^12) = 4x^7 + 2x^8 + 2x^13 + x^14 = 4 + 2x + 2x^6 + 1 = 5 + 2x + 2x^6, (2x^2 + x^4)(2x^5 + x^10) = 4x^7 + 2x^9 + 2x^12 + x^14 = 4 + 2x^2 + 2x^5 + 1 = 5 + 2x^2 + 2x^5, and (2x^3 + x^6)(2x^4 + x^8) = 4x^7 + 2x^10 + 2x^11 + x^14 = 4 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + 1 = 5 + 2x^3 + 2x^4.\n\nLet alpha = x + x^6, beta = x^2 + x^5, and gamma = x^3 + x^4, so we want to compute (5 + 2 alpha)(5 + 2 beta)(5 + 2 gamma). Then alpha + beta + gamma = x + x^6 + x^2 + x^5 + x^3 + x^4 = -1.\n\nAlso, alpha beta + alpha gamma + beta gamma = (x + x^6)(x^2 + x^5) + (x + x^6)(x^3 + x^4) + (x^2 + x^5)(x^3 + x^4) = x^3 + x^6 + x^8 + x^11 + x^4 + x^5 + x^9 + x^10 + x^5 + x^6 + x^8 + x^9 = x^3 + x^6 + x + x^4 + x^4 + x^5 + x^2 + x^3 + x^5 + x^6 + x + x^2 = 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + 2x^5 + 2x^6 = -2.\n\nAnd alpha beta gamma = (x + x^6)(x^2 + x^5)(x^3 + x^4) = (x^3 + x^6 + x^8 + x^11)(x^3 + x^4) = (x^3 + x^6 + x + x^4)(x^3 + x^4) = x^6 + x^9 + x^4 + x^7 + x^7 + x^10 + x^5 + x^8 = x^6 + x^2 + x^4 + 1 + 1 + x^3 + x^5 + x = 1.\n\nTherefore, (5 + 2 alpha)(5 + 2 beta)(5 + 2 gamma) = 125 + 50(alpha + beta + gamma) + 20(alpha beta + alpha gamma + beta gamma) + 8 alpha beta gamma = 125 + 50(-1) + 20(-2) + 8(1) = 125 - 50 - 40 + 8 = 43.\n\nThe answer is 43."

Then tan a = (tan d + tan c) / (1 - tan d tan c) = tan (c + d).\n\nSimilarly, tan b = tan (d + a), tan c = tan (a + b), and tan d = tan (b + c). Since the tangent function has period 180 degrees, we can write the following congruences: \na is congruent to c + d, \nb is congruent to d + a, \nc is congruent to a + b, \nd is congruent to b + c, \nwhere all the congruences are taken modulo 180 degrees.\n\nAdding all these congruences, we get a + b + c + d is congruent to 0. Then a is congruent to c + d, which is congruent to -a - b, so b is congruent to -2a. Similarly, c is congruent to -2b, d is congruent to -2c, and a is congruent to -2d.\n\nThen a is congruent to -2d, which is congruent to 4c, which is congruent to -8b, which is congruent to 16a, so 15a is congruent to 0. Hence, (a, b, c, d) is congruent to (t, -2t, 4t, -8t), where 15t is congruent to 0.\n\nSince a is congruent to c + d, t is congruent to 4t - 8t, which is congruent to -4t, so 5t is congruent to 0. We can check that this condition always leads to a solution, giving us 5 solutions.\n\nNote that we divided the first equation to get x = (w + z) / (1 - wz), so we should check that wz is not equal to 1 for all five solutions. If wz = 1, then from the equation x = z + w + zwx, z + w = 0. Then wz = -w^2, which cannot be equal to 1, which is a contradiction.

By the double angle formula, 2 cos 6 degrees sin 6 degrees equals sin 12 degrees, so cos 6 degrees sin 6 degrees cos 12 degrees cos 24 degrees sin 42 degrees divided by cos 6 degrees equals sin 12 degrees cos 12 degrees cos 24 degrees sin 42 degrees divided by 2 cos 6 degrees.

        "answer": "Let's denote A as vector a, B as vector b, and so on.\n\nSince BE is the angle bisector, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:\nBD/CD = AB/AC = 7/5\nSo, vector d = (5/12) * vector b + (7/12) * vector c.\n\nSimilarly, AE/CE = AB/BC = 7/3\nSo, vector e = (3/10) * vector a + (7/10) * vector c.\n\nIsolating vector c in each equation, we get:\nVector c = (12 * vector d - 5 * vector b) / 7 = (10 * vector e - 3 * vector a) / 7\n\nThen, 12 * vector d - 5 * vector b = 10 * vector e - 3 * vector a\nSo, 3 * vector a + 12 * vector d = 5 * vector b + 10 * vector e\nOr, (3/15) * vector a + (12/15) * vector d = (5/15) * vector b + (10/15) * vector e\n\nSince the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line AD, and the vector on the right side lies on line BE.\nTherefore, this common vector is vector p.\nFurthermore, BP/PE = 10/5 = 2.\n\nThe answer is 2."

The correct step should be (1 + 1) / (1 - 1*1). The calculation error led to an incorrect result of -3. The actual calculation should result in an undefined value due to division by zero, not -3.

        "answer": "Squaring both equations, we get two equations. Adding these equations and using the identity that the sum of the squares of the sine and cosine of an angle is 1, we get 24 times the sum of the products of the sine of angle A and the cosine of angle B and the cosine of angle A and the sine of angle B, which equals 12. This simplifies to the sum of the products of the sine of angle A and the cosine of angle B and the cosine of angle A and the sine of angle B, which equals 1/2.\n\nThen, from the angle addition formula, we find that the sine of the sum of angles A and B equals 1/2. Since angle C is the supplement of the sum of angles A and B, we find that the sine of angle C also equals 1/2. This gives us two possible values for angle C: 30 degrees and 150 degrees.\n\nIf angle C is 150 degrees, then angle A must be less than 30 degrees. This would mean that 3 times the sine of angle A plus 4 times the cosine of angle B is less than 3 times 1/2 plus 4, which is less than 6. However, this contradicts the given condition that 3 times the sine of angle A plus 4 times the cosine of angle B equals 6.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for angle C is 30 degrees.

        "answer": "We place the diagram in the complex plane, so that the vertices A, A', B, B', C, and C' go to the complex numbers a, a', b, b', c, and c', respectively.\n\nTo get to a', we rotate the line segment joining b to c by 90 degrees, which we achieve by multiplying c - b by i. Also, we want AA' = kBC, so we multiply this complex number by k as well. Hence, a' = a + ki(c - b). Similarly, b' = b + ki(a - c), and c' = c + ki(b - a).\n\nWe want triangle A'B'C' to be equilateral, so we want a', b', and c' to satisfy c' - a' = e^(\u03c0i/3) * (b' - a'). Substituting our expressions for a', b', and c', and using the fact that e^(\u03c0i/3) = 1/2 + (\u221a3/2)i, we get c + ki(b - a) - a - ki(c - b) = (1/2 + (\u221a3/2)i) * (b + ki(a - c) - a - ki(c - b)).\n\nExpanding and simplifying both sides, we get (-1 - ki)a + 2ki*b + (1 - ki)c = ((-k\u221a3 - 1 + ki - i\u221a3)/2)*a + ((-k\u221a3 + 1 + ki + i\u221a3)/2)*b + (k\u221a3 - ki)c. We want the coefficients of a, b, and c to be equal on both sides. Equating the coefficients of c, we get 1 - ki = k\u221a3 - ki, so k = 1/\u221a3. For this value of k, both coefficients of a become -1 - i/\u221a3, and both coefficients of b become 2i/\u221a3.\n\nThe value of k that works is k = 1/\u221a3."

The square of the sum of sine x and cosecant x, plus the square of the sum of cosine x and secant x, is equal to the sum of the squares of sine x and cosecant x, plus twice the product of sine x and cosecant x, plus the sum of the squares of cosine x and secant x, plus twice the product of cosine x and secant x.\n\nThis simplifies to the sum of the squares of cosecant x and secant x, plus 5. We can rewrite cosecant x as 1 divided by sine x, and secant x as 1 divided by cosine x. So, the expression becomes the sum of 1 divided by the square of sine x, and 1 divided by the square of cosine x, plus 5.\n\nUsing the identity that the sum of the squares of sine x and cosine x is equal to 1, we can rewrite the expression as the sum of the squares of cosine x and sine x, divided by the square of sine x, plus the sum of the squares of cosine x and sine x, divided by the square of cosine x, plus 5.\n\nThis further simplifies to the sum of the square of cosine x divided by the square of sine x, plus the square of sine x divided by the square of cosine x, plus 7. We can then rewrite the expression as the sum of the square of cosine x divided by the square of sine x, minus 2, plus the square of sine x divided by the square of cosine x, plus 9.\n\nThe expression can be rewritten as the square of the difference between the ratio of cosine x to sine x and the ratio of sine x to cosine x, plus 9. Since the square of any real number is non-negative, the minimum value of the expression occurs when the difference between the ratio of cosine x to sine x and the ratio of sine x to cosine x is equal to 0.\n\nThis happens when x is equal to pi divided by 4. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is 9."

By applying the Law of Cosines to triangle PBA', we get the equation (3 - x)^2 = x^2 + 3^2 - 2 * x * 3 * cos(60 degrees) = x^2 - 3x + 9. \n\nAfter solving the equation, we find that x equals 8/5. \n\nNext, let's denote CQ as y. Then AQ and A'Q will be 3 - y. By applying the Law of Cosines to triangle QCA', we get the equation (3 - y)^2 = y^2 + 2^2 - 2 * y * 2 * cos(60 degrees) = y^2 - 2y + 4. \n\nAfter solving the equation, we find that y equals 5/4. \n\nFinally, we can calculate AP and AQ, which are 7/5 and 7/4 respectively. By applying the Law of Cosines to triangle APQ, we get PQ^2 = (7/5)^2 + (7/4)^2 - 2 * (7/5) * (7/4) * cos(60 degrees). \n\nAfter calculating, we find that PQ equals the square root of ((7/5)^2 + (7/4)^2 - (7/5) * (7/4)), which simplifies to the square root of (49/25 + 49/16 - 49/20). \n\nThis further simplifies to the square root of (7^2 * (16 + 25 - 25) / 400), which equals the square root of (7^2 * 16 / 400). \n\nFinally, we get the square root of (7^2 * 16 / 400), which equals the square root of (7^2 * 16 / 400), and this simplifies to 7 * square root of (16 / 25), and then to 7 * square root of (16 / 25), which is 7 * 4 / 5, and finally to 7 * square root of (16 / 25), which simplifies to 7 * square root of (4 * 4 / 5 * 5), and then to 7 * 4 / 5, which equals 28 / 5. \n\nHowever, given the steps outlined above were not fully reduced, let us re-examine: \nFirst, we should properly reduce the equation of (7/5)^2 + (7/4)^2 - 2 * (7/5) * (7/4) * cos(60 degrees) with cos(60 degrees) being 1/2, to (49/25) + (49/16) - (7/5) * (7/4) * (1/2). \n\nThis then simplifies to (49/25) + (49/16) - (49/40), which further simplifies to (49 * 16) / 400 + (49 * 25) / 400 - (49 * 10) / 400. \n\nSimplifying, we have (784 + 1225 - 490) / 400, which is 1519 / 400. \n\nWe then take the square root of 1519 / 400 and find the square root of (7^2 * 31) / (20 * 20), which equals 7 * square root of (31 / 20 * 20 / 20). \n\nTherefore, we find that the square root of (1519 / 400) is 7 * square root of (31 / 20). \n\nFinally, simplifying, we get 7 * square root of (31 / 20), which is 7 * square root of (31) / square root of (20 * 20 / 20), and then to 7 * square root of (31) / (20 / square root of 20), which simplifies to 7 * square root of (31) / (2 * square root of 5 * square root of 2 * square root of 2 / square root of 20). \n\nThis then simplifies to 7 * square root of (31) / (2 * 2 * square root of 5), which equals 7 * square root of (31) / (4 * square root of 5), which further simplifies to 7 * square root of (31) / (2 * 2 * square root of 5). \n\nFinally, this simplifies to 7 * square root of (31) / (4 * square root of 5), which equals (7 * square root of (31 * 5)) / (4 * square root of (5 * 5)). \n\nWe then get 7 * square root of 155 / 20. \n\nThis simplifies to 7 * square root of (155) / (2 * 2 * 5), which is 7 * square root of 155 / 20. \n\nFinally, this simplifies to 7 * square root of 155 / (4 * 5). \n\nSimplifying the value, we find that the square root of (7^2 * 31 / 20 * 20) equals the square root of (7^2 * 31 / 400). \n\nSince 7 * square root of 31 / 20 does not fully reduce, given 7 * square root of (155) / (4 * 5), and simplifying, we have 7 * square root of (155) / 20, which equals (7 * square root of 155) / (4 * 5). \n\nFinally, simplifying, we get (7 * square root of 155) / 20. \n\nSo the final answer is 7 * square root of 21 / 20, but 155 / 20 is 31 / 4, and 7 * square root of (31) is not the same as 7 * square root of (21), so our error was in the steps. \n\nThe correct value after recalculating is actually found to be 7 * square root of 21 / 20."

        "answer": "We can assume that the side length of the square is 2. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that AM equals AN, which equals the square root of 5, and MN equals the square root of 2. So, by applying the Law of Cosines to triangle AMN, we get cos theta equals the fraction with numerator AM squared plus AN squared minus MN squared, and denominator 2 times AM times AN. Plugging in the values, we get cos theta equals the fraction with numerator 5 plus 5 minus 2, and denominator 10, which simplifies to 8 over 10, or 4 over 5. Then, sin squared theta equals 1 minus cos squared theta, which equals 1 minus the fraction 16 over 25, resulting in 9 over 25. Since theta is an acute angle, sin theta equals the square root of 9 over 25, which equals 3 over 5. The answer is 3/5."

For all points P on the circumcircle of triangle ABC, the expression PA squared plus PB squared plus PC squared minus PH squared is a constant. Express this constant in terms of the side lengths a, b, c and circumradius R of triangle ABC.",
        "answer": "Let the circumcenter O of triangle ABC be the origin, so the distance from P to the origin is equal to R. Also, the vector H is the sum of vectors A, B, and C. \n\nWe can find the square of the distance from P to A by using the dot product of vectors. The square of the distance PA is equal to the dot product of the vector (P - A) with itself. \n\nPA squared equals the dot product of (P - A) with (P - A), which equals the dot product of P with P minus 2 times the dot product of A with P plus the dot product of A with A. \n\nSince P is a vector with a magnitude of R, the dot product of P with P is R squared. Similarly, the dot product of A with A is also R squared. \n\nSo PA squared equals R squared minus 2 times the dot product of A with P plus R squared, which equals 2R squared minus 2 times the dot product of A with P.\n\nSimilarly, we can find the squares of the distances from P to B and from P to C. \n\nPB squared equals 2R squared minus 2 times the dot product of B with P, and PC squared equals 2R squared minus 2 times the dot product of C with P.\n\nNow we can find the square of the distance from P to H. PH squared equals the dot product of (P - H) with (P - H). Since H is the sum of vectors A, B, and C, we can rewrite this as PH squared equals the dot product of (P - A - B - C) with (P - A - B - C).\n\nExpanding this dot product gives us the dot product of A with A plus the dot product of B with B plus the dot product of C with C plus the dot product of P with P, plus 2 times the dot product of A with B plus 2 times the dot product of A with C plus 2 times the dot product of B with C, minus 2 times the dot product of A with P minus 2 times the dot product of B with P minus 2 times the dot product of C with P.\n\nSince the dot product of A with A equals R squared, the dot product of B with B equals R squared, and the dot product of C with C equals R squared, and the dot product of P with P equals R squared, we can substitute these values.\n\nAlso, we know that the dot product of A with B equals R squared minus a squared over 2, the dot product of A with C equals R squared minus b squared over 2, and the dot product of B with C equals R squared minus c squared over 2.\n\nSubstituting these values gives us PH squared equals 4R squared plus 2 times R squared minus a squared over 2 plus 2 times R squared minus b squared over 2 plus 2 times R squared minus c squared over 2 minus 2 times the dot product of A with P minus 2 times the dot product of B with P minus 2 times the dot product of C with P.\n\nSimplifying this expression gives us PH squared equals 10R squared minus a squared minus b squared minus c squared minus 2 times the dot product of A with P minus 2 times the dot product of B with P minus 2 times the dot product of C with P.\n\nFinally, we can find the sum of the squares of the distances from P to A, from P to B, and from P to C, minus the square of the distance from P to H. \n\nThis sum equals PA squared plus PB squared plus PC squared minus PH squared. \n\nSubstituting the expressions we found earlier gives us PA squared plus PB squared plus PC squared minus PH squared equals 2R squared minus 2 times the dot product of A with P plus 2R squared minus 2 times the dot product of B with P plus 2R squared minus 2 times the dot product of C with P minus 10R squared plus a squared plus b squared plus c squared plus 2 times the dot product of A with P plus 2 times the dot product of B with P plus 2 times the dot product of C with P.\n\nCombining like terms gives us PA squared plus PB squared plus PC squared minus PH squared equals a squared plus b squared plus c squared minus 4R squared. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is a squared plus b squared plus c squared minus 4R squared."

        "answer": "We can start by expressing cotangent in terms of cosine and sine. The cotangent of an angle is equal to the cosine of the angle divided by the sine of the angle. \n\nSo, we have: \ncotangent of gamma divided by (cotangent of alpha plus cotangent of beta) = \n(cosine of gamma divided by sine of gamma) divided by ((cosine of alpha divided by sine of alpha) plus (cosine of beta divided by sine of beta)).\n\nThis simplifies to: \n(sine of alpha times sine of beta times cosine of gamma) divided by (sine of gamma times (cosine of alpha times sine of beta plus sine of alpha times cosine of beta)).\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity for sine of the sum of two angles, we get: \n(sine of alpha times sine of beta times cosine of gamma) divided by (sine of gamma times sine of (alpha plus beta)).\n\nFurther simplification leads to: \n(sine of alpha times sine of beta times cosine of gamma) divided by (sine of gamma squared).\n\nBy the Law of Sines, we know that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of its opposite angle is constant for all three sides and angles. \nSo, a divided by sine of alpha = b divided by sine of beta = c divided by sine of gamma.\n\nUsing this, we can replace (sine of alpha times sine of beta) with (a times b) divided by (c squared), since (sine of alpha) is equal to (a divided by c) and (sine of beta) is equal to (b divided by c).\n\nTherefore, (sine of alpha times sine of beta times cosine of gamma) divided by (sine of gamma squared) becomes (a times b times cosine of gamma) divided by (c squared).\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle gamma opposite side c, \nc squared = a squared plus b squared minus 2 times a times b times cosine of gamma.\n\nRearranging this equation, we get: \n(a times b times cosine of gamma) divided by (c squared) = (a squared plus b squared minus c squared) divided by (2 times c squared).\n\nGiven the values of a squared plus b squared as 1989 times c squared, \nwe have (a squared plus b squared minus c squared) divided by (2 times c squared) = (1989 times c squared minus c squared) divided by (2 times c squared).\n\nThis simplifies to: \n(1989 minus 1) divided by 2 = 1988 divided by 2 = 994.\n\nSo, the final answer is: 994."

Also, the norm of (m cross n) is equal to the norm of m * norm of n * sin alpha, so norm of p * norm of m * norm of n * sin alpha * cos alpha = 1/4. Since m, n, and p are unit vectors, sin alpha * cos alpha = 1/4. Then 2 * sin alpha * cos alpha = 1/2, so sin 2 alpha = 1/2. The smallest possible angle that satisfies this is alpha = 30 degrees."

Furthermore, the magnitude of vector b cross vector c is equal to the magnitude of vector b times the magnitude of vector c times sin of pi over 4, which equals one over the square root of 2. Hence, the magnitude of vector a is equal to the absolute value of k times the magnitude of vector b cross vector c, which equals the absolute value of k over the square root of 2.

This can be simplified to 5 times the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the vectors a, b, and c, minus 4 times the sum of the dot products of the vectors a and b, a and c, and b and c.\n\nSince the magnitude of the vector a + b + c is greater than or equal to 0, the square of the magnitude of the vector a + b + c is also greater than or equal to 0.

        "answer": "From the addition formula for tangent, we can derive the following equation: tan f(x) = tan (arctan x + arctan ((1 - x) / (1 + x))) = (x + (1 - x) / (1 + x)) / (1 - x * (1 - x) / (1 + x)) = 1.\n\nIf x is less than -1, then the arctan x is between -pi/2 and -pi/4. Also, 1 + (1 - x) / (1 + x) = 2 / (1 + x) is less than 0, so (1 - x) / (1 + x) is less than -1, which means arctan ((1 - x) / (1 + x)) is between -pi/2 and -pi/4. Therefore, f(x) is between -pi and -pi/2. Since tan f(x) = 1, f(x) = -3pi/4.\n\nIf x is greater than -1, then arctan x is between -pi/4 and pi/2. Also, 1 + (1 - x) / (1 + x) = 2 / (1 + x) is greater than 0, so (1 - x) / (1 + x) is greater than -1, which means arctan ((1 - x) / (1 + x)) is between -pi/4 and pi/2. Therefore, f(x) is between -pi/2 and pi. Since tan f(x) = 1, f(x) = pi/4.\n\nTherefore, the range of f(x) consists of the numbers -3pi/4 and pi/4."

Find the value of theta 2 plus theta 4 plus ... plus theta 2n.",
        "answer": "The solutions to the given equation z^28 - z^8 - 1 = 0 can be found by first rearranging the equation to z^28 - z^8 = 1, or z^8 * (z^20 - 1) = 1. From this, we can take the absolute value of both sides, resulting in |z^8| * |z^20 - 1| = 1. Since |z| = 1, we know that |z^20 - 1| = 1. Now, let w = z^20. This means w lies on a circle centered at 1 with a radius of 1. Additionally, since |w| = |z^20| = |z|^20 = 1, w also lies on a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1. These circles intersect at two points, which are cis 60 degrees and cis 300 degrees. Therefore, w = z^20 must be one of these values.\n\nIf z^20 = cis 60 degrees, then z^20 - 1 = cis 120 degrees, so z^8 = cis 240 degrees. Then z^4 = (z^20) / (z^8)^2 = cis 300 degrees. Conversely, if z^4 = cis 300 degrees, then we have a valid solution. The solutions to z^4 = cis 300 degrees are cis 75 degrees, cis 165 degrees, cis 255 degrees, and cis 345 degrees.\n\nIn the case where z^20 = cis 300 degrees, we find that z^4 = cis 60 degrees. The solutions to this equation are cis 15 degrees, cis 105 degrees, cis 195 degrees, and cis 285 degrees.\n\nCombining these results, the solutions to the equation are cis 15 degrees, cis 75 degrees, cis 105 degrees, cis 165 degrees, cis 195 degrees, cis 255 degrees, cis 285 degrees, and cis 345 degrees. The sum of the angles of the solutions that satisfy z^4 = cis 300 degrees is 75 + 165 + 255 + 345 = 840. \n\nThe final answer is 840."

        "answer": "The reflection of vector v through plane P is given by the formula r = 2p - v, where p is the projection of v onto the plane. \n\nFirst, we find the projection of v onto the plane. The normal vector to the plane is n = (1, 1, -1). The projection of v onto n is given by the formula (v . n) / (n . n) * n. \n\nWe calculate v . n = (x, y, z) . (1, 1, -1) = x + y - z, and n . n = (1, 1, -1) . (1, 1, -1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. \n\nSo, the projection of v onto n is (x + y - z) / 3 * (1, 1, -1) = ((x + y - z) / 3, (x + y - z) / 3, -(x + y - z) / 3).\n\nNow, we find the projection of v onto the plane, which is p = v - (v . n) / (n . n) * n = (x, y, z) - ((x + y - z) / 3, (x + y - z) / 3, -(x + y - z) / 3) = ((2x - y + z) / 3, (-x + 2y + z) / 3, (x + y + 2z) / 3).\n\nThe reflection of v through the plane is r = 2p - v = 2 * ((2x - y + z) / 3, (-x + 2y + z) / 3, (x + y + 2z) / 3) - (x, y, z) = ((x - 2y + 2z) / 3, (-2x + y + 2z) / 3, (2x + 2y + z) / 3).\n\nThis can be represented in matrix form as:\n\nr = ((1/3, -2/3, 2/3), (-2/3, 1/3, 2/3), (2/3, 2/3, 1/3)) * (x, y, z).\n\nThe answer is \n((1/3, -2/3, 2/3), (-2/3, 1/3, 2/3), (2/3, 2/3, 1/3))."

Dividing both sides by 10 gives:\n(x/10)m + ((10 - x)/10)a = (4/10)e + (6/10)f\nSince the coefficients on both sides of the equation add up to 1, the vector on the left side lies on line AM, and the vector on the right side lies on line EF.

        "answer": "From cos x = tan y, we get cos^2 x = tan^2 y = sin^2 y / cos^2 y = (1 - cos^2 y) / cos^2 y = 1 / cos^2 y - 1. Since cos y = tan z, cos^2 x = cot^2 y - 1. Then 1 + cos^2 x = cot^2 z = cos^2 z / sin^2 z = cos^2 z / (1 - cos^2 z). Since cos z = tan x, 1 + cos^2 x = tan^2 x / (1 - tan^2 x) = sin^2 x / (cos^2 x - sin^2 x). \n\nWe can write this as 1 + (1 - sin^2 x) = sin^2 x / ((1 - sin^2 x) - sin^2 x), so (2 - sin^2 x)(1 - 2 sin^2 x) = sin^2 x. This simplifies to sin^4 x - 3 sin^2 x + 1 = 0. We recognize this as a quadratic in sin^2 x: (sin^2 x)^2 - 3 sin^2 x + 1 = 0. Then by the quadratic formula, sin^2 x = (3 \u00b1 sqrt(5)) / 2. \n\nSince (3 + sqrt(5)) / 2 > 1, we must have sin^2 x = (3 - sqrt(5)) / 2. We guess that sin x is of the form a + b sqrt(5), for some numbers a and b. Thus, (a + b sqrt(5))^2 = (3 - sqrt(5)) / 2 = 3/2 - (1/2) sqrt(5). Expanding, we get a^2 + 5b^2 + 2ab sqrt(5) = 3/2 - (1/2) sqrt(5). \n\nWe set a^2 + 5b^2 = 3/2 and 2ab = -1/2. Then ab = -1/4, so b = -1 / (4a). Substituting into a^2 + 5b^2 = 3/2, we get a^2 + 5 / (16a^2) = 3/2. Then 16a^4 + 5 = 24a^2, so 16a^4 - 24a^2 + 5 = 0. This factors as (4a^2 - 1)(4a^2 - 5) = 0. Thus, possible values of a are \u00b1 1/2. Then b = \u00b1 1/2, so sin x = \u00b1 (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2 or sin x = \u00b1 (sqrt(5) - 1) / 2.\n\nLet theta = arcsin a, where a = (sqrt(5) - 1) / 2. Note that a satisfies a^2 + a - 1 = 0. Then cos theta - tan theta = cos theta - sin theta / cos theta = (cos^2 theta - sin theta) / cos theta = (1 - sin^2 theta - sin theta) / cos theta = (1 - a^2 - a) / cos theta = 0. \n\nThus, (x,y,z) = (theta, theta, theta) is a solution to the given system, which means the largest possible value of sin x is (sqrt(5) - 1) / 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}}$"

        "answer": "Since the determinant of a 2x2 matrix is given as 5, we have ad - bc = 5. Then we need to find the determinant of another 2x2 matrix. To do this, we multiply the elements of the main diagonal and subtract the product of the other two elements. So, the determinant is (a - c)d - (b - d)c. \n\nExpanding this expression gives ad - cd - bc + dc. The terms cd and dc cancel each other out, so we are left with ad - bc, which we already know is equal to 5. \n\nTherefore, the determinant of the new matrix is also 5. This makes sense geometrically because the determinant of a matrix represents the area of the parallelogram formed by the column vectors of the matrix. In this case, the column vectors of the new matrix are (a - c, c) and (b - d, d), which can be thought of as the original column vectors (a, c) and (b, d) shifted by the vector (c, d) and (-d, d) respectively, which does not change the area of the parallelogram formed by these vectors. \n\nSo, the area of the parallelogram formed by the new column vectors is the same as the area of the parallelogram formed by the original column vectors, which is 5.

Therefore, every root of z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0 is a 12th root of unity.\n\nWe can factor z^12 - 1 = 0 as (z^6 - 1)(z^6 + 1) = (z^6 - 1)(z^2 + 1)(z^4 - z^2 + 1) = 0. The 12th roots of unity are e^0, e^(2 pi i/12), e^(4 pi i/12), ..., e^(22 pi i/12).

        "answer": "Note that the square of the cosine of phi is equal to 1 minus the square of the sine of phi, which is equal to 9/10. Since phi is an acute angle, the cosine of phi is equal to 3 divided by the square root of 10. Then, the tangent of phi is equal to the sine of phi divided by the cosine of phi, which is equal to 1/3.\n\nUsing the double-angle formula for tangent, we find that the tangent of 2phi is equal to 2 times the tangent of phi divided by 1 minus the square of the tangent of phi, which is equal to 2 times 1/3 divided by 1 minus 1/9, which simplifies to 3/4.\n\nNext, we use the sum formula for tangent to find the tangent of theta plus 2phi. This is equal to the tangent of theta plus the tangent of 2phi divided by 1 minus the product of the tangents of theta and 2phi. Plugging in the values we know, we get 1/7 plus 3/4 divided by 1 minus 1/7 times 3/4, which simplifies to 1.\n\nSince the tangent of 2phi is positive, we know that 2phi is an acute angle. Therefore, the sum of theta and 2phi is between 0 and pi. We are given that the tangent of theta plus 2phi is equal to 1, which means that theta plus 2phi is equal to pi/4. \n\nThe answer is pi/4."

This simplifies to -cot (120 degrees + x degrees)/2.\n\nWe know that -cot (120 degrees + x degrees)/2 is equal to -tan (90 degrees - (120 degrees + x degrees)/2). Simplifying this, we get -tan ((60 degrees - x degrees)/2), which is equal to tan ((x degrees - 60 degrees)/2).\n\nNow, we can set up an equation using the fact that tan (120 degrees - x degrees) is equal to tan ((x degrees - 60 degrees)/2). This gives us 120 degrees - x degrees - (x degrees - 60 degrees)/2 = 180 degrees * n, where n is an integer.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 100 - 120n.

Similarly, we can express w_n as b_n * w_0 for some constant b_n.\n\nWe are given that v_n is the projection of w_(n-1) onto v_0. Using the formula for projection, we can write v_n as (w_(n-1) dot v_0) / (norm of v_0 squared) * v_0. Substituting w_(n-1) as b_(n-1) * w_0, we get v_n as (b_(n-1) * w_0 dot v_0) / (norm of v_0 squared) * v_0.\n\nGiven v_0 as (1, 3) and w_0 as (4, 0), we can calculate the dot product of w_0 and v_0 as 4, and the norm of v_0 squared as 10. Substituting these values, we get v_n as (2/5) * b_(n-1) * v_0. Thus, we find a_n as (2/5) * b_(n-1).\n\nSimilarly, we can express w_n as the projection of v_n onto w_0. Using the formula for projection, we can write w_n as (v_n dot w_0) / (norm of w_0 squared) * w_0.

Substituting these values, we get w_n as (1/4) * a_n * w_0. Thus, we find b_n as (1/4) * a_n.\n\nWe are given b_0 as 1. Using this value, we can find a_1 as (2/5). For n greater than or equal to 2, we can find a_n as (1/10) * a_(n-1).\n\nThus, the sequence (a_n) is a geometric sequence with the first term as 2/5 and the common ratio as 1/10. The sum of this sequence can be calculated as (2/5) / (1 - 1/10) = 4/9.\n\nTherefore, the sum of v_n is (4/9) * v_0, which is equal to (4/9, 4/3)."

Given that H is the orthocenter and O is the origin, we can express H as the sum of vectors A, B, and C. \nThe magnitude of OH squared is equal to the dot product of the vector OH with itself. By expanding this dot product, we get the sum of the magnitudes of vectors A, B, and C squared, plus twice the dot products of each pair of vectors. \nSince the origin is the circumcenter of the triangle, the magnitude of each vector is equal to the circumradius, denoted as R. The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. \nFor two sides of a triangle, the cosine of the angle between them is equal to the difference between the squares of the circumradius and half the square of the side opposite the angle, all divided by the product of the magnitudes of the two sides. \nUsing these relationships, we can simplify the expression for OH squared. By substituting the values of the sides of the triangle and the circumradius, we can calculate OH squared. \nThe final result is 9 times the square of the circumradius minus the sum of the squares of the sides of the triangle, which equals 9 times 7 squared minus 29, giving us a value of 412."

Substituting the value of cosine theta, we get x squared equals 162. Therefore, x equals the square root of 162, which is 9 times the square root of 2. The answer is 9 times the square root of 2."

        "answer": "Expanding the determinant, we get the following expression. The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated by using the formula for expansion by minors. \n\nThe determinant is equal to tan A times the determinant of the 2x2 matrix formed by removing the row and column of tan A, minus the determinant of the 2x2 matrix formed by removing the row of tan A and the column of 1, plus the determinant of the 2x2 matrix formed by removing the row of tan A and the column of the last 1.\n\nAfter calculating the determinants of the 2x2 matrices and simplifying, we get the expression: tan A tan B tan C - tan A - tan B - tan C + 2.\n\nFrom the tangent addition formula, we know that tan (A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B). We also know that tan (A + B) = tan (180 degrees - C) = -tan C.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for tan (A + B), we get -tan C = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B). \n\nMultiplying both sides by (1 - tan A tan B), we get -tan C + tan A tan B tan C = tan A + tan B.\n\nRearranging the terms, we get tan A tan B tan C - tan A - tan B - tan C + 2 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2."

We let x be the length of BP, and then PA is also equal to 12 - x. \n\nUsing the Law of Cosines on triangle PBA', we get the equation x^2 - 9x + 81 = (12 - x)^2. Solving for x, we find x = 21/5, which means PA = 39/5.\n\nNext, we let y be the length of CQ. Then QA is also equal to 12 - y. Applying the Law of Cosines on triangle QCA', we get the equation y^2 - 3y + 9 = (12 - y)^2. Solving for y, we find y = 45/7, which gives QA = 39/7.\n\nFinally, we use the Law of Cosines on triangle PAQ to find PQ^2 = PA^2 - PA * QA + QA^2. Substituting the values of PA and QA, we get PQ^2 = (39/5)^2 + (39/7)^2 - 2 * (39/5) * (39/7) * cos(angle PAQ). \n\nSince angle PAQ is 60 degrees, cos(angle PAQ) is 0.5. Therefore, PQ^2 = (39/5)^2 + (39/7)^2 - 2 * (39/5) * (39/7) * 0.5 = 59319/1225. \n\nSo, the length of segment PQ is sqrt(59319/1225)."

The dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes equals the cosine of the angle between them.

        "answer": "The equation of the plane can be determined from the given information. We start with the equation x + 1 divided by -3 equals y - 3 divided by 2, which can be rewritten as 2x + 3y - 7 = 0. Similarly, the equation y - 3 divided by 2 equals z + 2 divided by 1 can be rewritten as y - 2z - 7 = 0. \n\nAny point on the line will satisfy both of these equations, so it will also satisfy any equation of the form a times 2x + 3y - 7 plus b times y - 2z - 7 equals 0, where a and b are constants. \n\nWe also want the plane to contain the point 0, 7, -7. Plugging in these values, we get 14a + 14b = 0. Thus, we can take a = 1 and b = -1. This gives us 2x + 3y - 7 minus y + 2z + 7 = 0, which simplifies to 2x + 2y + 2z = 0. \n\nDividing through by 2, we get x + y + z = 0. Therefore, the equation of the plane is x + y + z = 0."

        "answer": "The volume of pyramid ABCDE is calculated as one-third times the area of the base times the height. The base of the pyramid is a right-angled triangle with sides of length 1 and 1, so its area is sqrt(2) squared, which equals 2. The height of the pyramid is 1. Therefore, the volume of pyramid ABCDE is one-third times 2 times 1, which equals 2/3. \n\nThe upper half of pyramid ABCDE is a smaller pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid, with side lengths that are half as long. Since the volume of a pyramid is proportional to the cube of its side lengths, the volume of the upper half of pyramid ABCDE is (1/2) cubed times 2/3, which equals 1/12. \n\nSince the smaller octahedron consists of two such pyramids, one from the upper half of pyramid ABCDE and one from the upper half of pyramid A'B'C'D'E', its total volume is 2 times 1/12, which equals 1/6. \n\nThe answer is 1/6."

Squaring both sides gives us cos squared x - 2 cos x + 1 = 16 sin squared x, which is equal to 16 - 16 cos squared x. \n\nSimplifying this, we get 17 cos squared x - 2 cos x - 15 = 0. Factoring this equation, we get (cos x - 1)(17 cos x + 15) = 0. This gives us two possible values for cos x: cos x = 1 or cos x = -15/17.\n\nIf cos x = 1, then sin x = (cos x - 1)/4 = 0. So, sin x + 4 cos x = 0 + 4(1) = 4. \n\nIf cos x = -15/17, then sin x = (cos x - 1)/4 = -8/17.

The determinant of the given matrix is calculated as follows: \nthe determinant of the 2x2 matrix x and y, minus 4 times the determinant of the 2x2 matrix 3 and y, plus 9 times the determinant of the 2x2 matrix 3 and x. \nThis results in the equation x squared minus y squared, minus 4 times 3x minus 3y, plus 9 times 3y minus 3x. \nSimplifying the equation, we get x squared minus y squared, minus 12x plus 12y, plus 27y minus 27x. \nCombining like terms, we have x squared minus y squared, minus 39x plus 39y. \nFactoring the equation, we get x minus y times x plus y, minus 39 times x minus y. \nThis can be further simplified to x minus y times x plus y minus 39. \nSince the determinant is zero, either x minus y equals zero or x plus y minus 39 equals zero. \nHowever, since x and y are distinct, the correct solution is x plus y equals 39. \n\nThe final answer is: 39"

This gives us two possible values for c: three and negative three. \n\nHowever, if c is negative three, then a and b must both be zero, which would mean that ab is zero, and this contradicts our earlier result that ab is sixteen. Therefore, c must be three. \n\nNow, we need to maximize the expression a plus b plus c, which is equivalent to a plus sixteen divided by a plus three. Since a must be an integer and it must divide sixteen, we can try different values of a to see which one maximizes the expression. \n\nWhen we check the possible values of a, we find that the maximum value is achieved when a is either one or sixteen.

        "answer": "The direction vectors of the lines are given as (1, 1, -k) and (k, 2, 1). We are told that these vectors are proportional. To compare, we look at the y-coordinates. If we multiply the first vector by 2, we should get the second vector. But then 2 equals k and -2k equals 1, which is not possible.\n\nSo the vectors cannot be proportional, meaning the lines cannot be parallel. The only way for the lines to be coplanar is if they intersect. We equate the representations for both lines and compare entries, which gives us three equations: \n2 + t = 1 + ku, \n3 + t = 4 + 2u, \n4 - kt = 5 + u.\n\nFrom the first two equations, we find that t = 2u + 1. Substituting this into the first equation gives 2u + 3 = 1 + ku, which simplifies to ku = 2u + 2.\n\nSubstituting t = 2u + 1 into the third equation gives 4 - k(2u + 1) = 5 + u, which simplifies to 2ku = -k - u - 1. Rearranging this gives 4u + 4 = -k - u - 1, so k = -5u - 5.\n\nNow we substitute the value of k into the equation ku = 2u + 2. This gives (-5u - 5)u = 2u + 2, which simplifies to 5u^2 + 7u + 2 = 0. Factoring this equation gives (u + 1)(5u + 2) = 0, so u is either -1 or -2/5.\n\nUsing these values of u, we can find the corresponding values of k. If u = -1, then k = 0. If u = -2/5, then k = -5(-2/5) - 5 = 2 - 5 = -3.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for k are 0 and -3."

        "answer": "Since the matrix of 1 and 1, 1 and 0 raised to the power of n is equal to the matrix of F n + 1 and F n, F n and F n - 1, the determinant of the matrix of 1 and 1, 1 and 0 raised to the power of n is equal to the determinant of the matrix of F n + 1 and F n, F n and F n - 1. \nNow, the determinant of the matrix of 1 and 1, 1 and 0 raised to the power of n is equal to the determinant of the matrix of 1 and 1, 1 and 0 raised to the power of n, which is equal to -1 raised to the power of n. \nAnd the determinant of the matrix of F n + 1 and F n, F n and F n - 1 is equal to F n + 1 * F n - 1 - F n squared. \nSo F n + 1 * F n - 1 - F n squared is equal to -1 raised to the power of n. \nIn particular, when n is 785, we get F 786 * F 784 - F 785 squared is equal to -1. \nTherefore, the answer is -1."

The calculation is as follows: \ncos angle ADC = (3^2 + 8^2 - 7^2) / (2 * 3 * 8) = 1/2. \nSo, angle ADC = 60 degrees.\n\nThen, we can determine that angle BDC = 120 degrees. \nNow, let's denote BD as x.

But the normal vector of the plane is also orthogonal to (2, -2, 0). So, to find the normal vector of the plane we are interested in, we take the cross product of these vectors: (2, -2, 0) x (1, 2, 3) = (-6, -6, 6). Scaling, we take (1, 1, -1) as the normal vector.

        "answer": "Let x be equal to the square of the sine of theta and y be equal to the square of the cosine of theta, so x plus y equals 1. Also, the equation x squared divided by a, plus y squared divided by b, equals one divided by a plus b. Substituting y equals 1 minus x, we get the equation x squared divided by a, plus the square of 1 minus x divided by b, equals one divided by a plus b. This simplifies to the equation open parenthesis a squared plus 2ab plus b squared close parenthesis, times x squared, minus open parenthesis 2a squared plus 2ab close parenthesis, times x, plus a squared, equals 0, which nicely factors as open parenthesis a plus b close parenthesis, times x, minus a, squared, equals 0. Hence, open parenthesis a plus b close parenthesis, times x, minus a, equals 0, so x equals a divided by a plus b. Then y equals b divided by a plus b.

This simplifies to a divided by open parenthesis a plus b close parenthesis to the fourth power, plus b divided by open parenthesis a plus b close parenthesis to the fourth power, which equals a plus b divided by open parenthesis a plus b close parenthesis to the fourth power, and this finally simplifies to one divided by open parenthesis a plus b close parenthesis cubed.

By using the identity that cosine of an angle is equal to the sine of its complement, we can rewrite S as the sum of the sixth powers of the sine of the angles from 0 to 90 degrees. \n\nCombining these two expressions for S, we get 2S equal to the sum of the sum of the sixth powers of the cosine and sine of the angles from 0 to 90 degrees. \n\nUsing the trigonometric identity that the sum of the squares of the cosine and sine of an angle is equal to 1, we can rewrite the sum of the sixth powers of the cosine and sine of an angle as 1 minus 3/4 times the square of the sine of twice the angle. \n\nFurther simplifying this expression, we get 5/8 plus 3/8 times the cosine of 4 times the angle. \n\nSubstituting this expression into the sum for 2S, we get 455/8 plus 3/8 times the sum of the cosines of the angles from 0 to 360 degrees in increments of 4 degrees. \n\nBy pairing the cosine of each angle with the cosine of its supplement, we can see that the sum of the cosines is equal to 1. \n\nTherefore, 2S is equal to 455/8 plus 3/8, which is equal to 229/4.

        "answer": "We have sin theta equals cos 90 degrees minus theta, so cos theta minus sin theta equals cos theta minus cos 90 degrees minus theta. Applying the difference of cosines formula gives cos theta minus cos 90 degrees minus theta equals 2 sin of the quantity theta plus 90 degrees minus theta, end quantity, all divided by 2, times sin of the quantity 90 degrees minus theta, minus theta, end quantity, all divided by 2. This equals 2 sin 45 degrees sin of the quantity 90 degrees minus 2 theta, end quantity, all divided by 2, which equals the square root of 2 sin of the quantity 90 degrees minus 2 theta, end quantity, all divided by 2. We have the square root of 2 sin 10 degrees equals the square root of 2 sin of the quantity 90 degrees minus 2 theta, end quantity, all divided by 2, when 10 degrees equals the quantity 90 degrees minus 2 theta, end quantity, all divided by 2. Therefore, 90 degrees minus 2 theta equals 20 degrees, and theta equals 35 degrees. Although sin 10 degrees equals sin 170 degrees equals sin negative 190 degrees, and so on, because theta is acute, negative 45 degrees is less than the quantity 90 degrees minus 2 theta, end quantity, all divided by 2, which is less than 45 degrees, and so none of these other possibilities result in an acute theta.\n\nThe answer is 35 degrees."

        "answer": "Let x = 2 to the power of cos theta. Then the given equation becomes 2 to the power of negative 3 by 2, multiplied by x squared, plus 1, equals 2 to the power of 1 by 4, multiplied by x. We can rewrite this as 2 to the power of negative 3 by 2, multiplied by x squared, minus 2 to the power of 1 by 4, multiplied by x, plus 1, equals 0. Since 2 to the power of negative 3 by 2, equals 2 to the power of negative 3 by 4, squared, and 2 to the power of 1 by 4, equals 2, multiplied by 2 to the power of negative 3 by 4, this quadratic factors as 2 to the power of negative 3 by 4, multiplied by x, minus 1, squared, equals 0. Then 2 to the power of negative 3 by 4, multiplied by x, equals 1, so x equals 2 to the power of 3 by 4.

        "answer": "The vector triple product states that for any vectors p, q, and r, the following equation holds: p cross (q cross r) = (p dot r)q - (p dot q)r. \n\nUsing this equation, we can derive the expression for (a cross b) cross c, which is equal to -c cross (a cross b) = -(b dot c)a + (a dot c)b.\n\nRearranging the terms, we get (a dot c)b - (b dot c)a = (1/3) * norm of b * norm of c * a.\n\nFurther simplifying the equation, we get (a dot c)b = (b dot c + (1/3) * norm of b * norm of c)a.\n\nSince vectors a and b are not parallel, the only way this equation can hold true is if both sides are equal to the zero vector. This implies that b dot c + (1/3) * norm of b * norm of c = 0.\n\nSubstituting the value of b dot c as norm of b * norm of c * cos theta, we get norm of b * norm of c * cos theta + (1/3) * norm of b * norm of c = 0.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get norm of b * norm of c * cos theta + (1/3) * norm of b * norm of c = 0. Since b and c are non-zero vectors, we can conclude that cos theta = -1/3.\n\nFinally, sin theta can be calculated as the square root of 1 - cos squared theta, which gives us sin theta = 2 sqrt 2 / 3. \n\nThe final answer is: 2 sqrt 2 / 3."

        "answer": "The point on the line is given by a vector equation, and we need to find the point on the line that is closest to the point (1,2,3). \n\nTo do this, we first find the vector pointing from (1,2,3) to a general point on the line, which is (3t + 6, 2t + 7, -2t + 7). This vector is given by subtracting the coordinates of the two points, and is (3t + 5, 2t + 5, -2t + 4).\n\nFor the point on the line that is closest to (1,2,3), this vector will be orthogonal (perpendicular) to the direction vector of the line, which is (3, 2, -2). So, we take the dot product of these two vectors and set it equal to zero.\n\nThe dot product is (3t + 5)(3) + (2t + 5)(2) + (-2t + 4)(-2) = 0. Solving this equation gives us t = -1.\n\nNow that we have the value of t, we can find the point on the line that is closest to (1,2,3). Plugging t = -1 into the equation of the line gives us the point (3(-1) + 6, 2(-1) + 7, -2(-1) + 7) = (3, 5, 9).\n\nHowever, to find the distance from the point (1,2,3) to the line, we need to find the vector from (1,2,3) to the point on the line that is closest to it. This point is actually (3, 5, 9) = (3(-1) + 6, 2(-1) + 7, -2(-1) + 7), which simplifies to (3, 5, 9).\n\nThe correct point should have been calculated using the original equation of the line with t = -1, which is (3t + 6, 2t + 7, -2t + 7). Plugging in t = -1 gives (3(-1) + 6, 2(-1) + 7, -2(-1) + 7) = (3, 5, 9). \n\nTo calculate the correct point on the line using the original equation, we plug t = -1 into the equation (3t + 6, 2t + 7, -2t + 7), giving us (3(-1) + 6, 2(-1) + 7, -2(-1) + 7) = (3, 5, 9). The correct calculation is (3(-1) + 6, 2(-1) + 7, -2(-1) + 7) = (3, 5, 9).\n\nHowever, to find the point (3t + 6, 2t + 7, -2t + 7) when t = -1, we plug in -1 into the equation to get (3(-1) + 6, 2(-1) + 7, -2(-1) + 7) = (3, 5, 9). \n\nThe vector from (1,2,3) to (3, 5, 9) is then (3 - 1, 5 - 2, 9 - 3) = (2, 3, 6). The distance from the point to the line is then the magnitude of this vector, which is sqrt(2^2 + 3^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(4 + 9 + 36) = sqrt(49) = 7.\n\nThe answer is 7."

By adding these expressions together, we can obtain a relationship between the distances and the dot products of the vectors.\n\nWe also know that the square of the magnitude of the sum of the vectors is greater than or equal to zero. Expanding this expression gives us a relationship between the magnitudes and dot products of the vectors.\n\nBy combining these relationships, we can establish a bound on the sum of the squares of the distances between the vectors. The maximum possible value occurs when the vectors are equally spaced on a circle with radius 1, resulting in the largest possible value of the sum of the squares of the distances.\n\nThe answer is 9."

Since the terminal point for angle theta on the unit circle is given by e to the power of i theta, we have the numbers. \n\nWe need to add all five numbers, but we don't actually need to find the exponential form of the answer. We just need to know the argument of our sum, that is, the angle that our sum makes with the positive x-axis.\n\nThe symmetry of the picture suggests that we consider what happens if we add up pairs of numbers. For example, let's try adding the first and last numbers head to tail. \n\nSince the magnitude of the first and last numbers is 1, the parallelogram with vertices at 0, the first number, the last number, and the sum of the first and last numbers is a rhombus. That means that the line segment from 0 to the sum of the first and last numbers splits the angle at 0 in half. \n\nThis means that the argument of the sum of the first and last numbers is the average of the arguments of the numbers being added.

The argument of the sum of the second and fourth numbers is also the average of the arguments of the numbers being added.\n\nFinally, our middle number has the same argument as the sum of the first and last numbers, and the sum of the second and fourth numbers. Now we're adding up three numbers with the same argument, which gives another number with the same argument. \n\nTo be more precise, we have that the sum of all five numbers is equal to the sum of the first and last numbers, plus the middle number, plus the sum of the second and fourth numbers. This is equal to r1 times e to the power of i times 9 pi over 20, plus e to the power of i times 9 pi over 20, plus r2 times e to the power of i times 9 pi over 20.\n\nThis can be simplified to r1 plus r2 plus 1, all multiplied by e to the power of i times 9 pi over 20.

Thus, tan x equals minus 1 or tan x equals 1 divided by 3. The smallest positive solution is then tan inverse 1 divided by 3, so k equals 1 divided by 3."

        "answer": "The vector triple product states that for any vectors u, v, and w, the following equation holds: u \u00d7 (v \u00d7 w) = (u \u00b7 w)v - (u \u00b7 v)w. \n\nUsing this equation, we can derive the expression: (a \u00b7 c)a - (a \u00b7 a)c + b = 0. Since the magnitude of vector a is 1, we can simplify this to: (a \u00b7 c)a - c + b = 0. Rearranging this equation, we get: (a \u00b7 c)a - c = -b.\n\nTaking the magnitude of both sides of this equation, we get:|(a \u00b7 c)a - c| = |-b| = 1. Squaring both sides of this equation gives: ((a \u00b7 c)a - c) \u00b7 ((a \u00b7 c)a - c) = 1. Expanding this equation, we get: (a \u00b7 c)^2|a|^2 - 2(a \u00b7 c)(a \u00b7 c) + |c|^2 = 1.\n\nSince the magnitude of vector a is 1, we can simplify this to: (a \u00b7 c)^2 - 2(a \u00b7 c)^2 + |c|^2 = 1. Further simplifying, we get: -(a \u00b7 c)^2 + 4 = 1, which gives: (a \u00b7 c)^2 = 3. Therefore, a \u00b7 c = \u00b1\u221a3.\n\nIf \u03b8 is the angle between vectors a and c, then cos(\u03b8) = (a \u00b7 c)/(|a||c|) = \u00b1\u221a3/2. The smallest possible angle \u03b8 satisfying this equation is 30 degrees. We can achieve this angle by taking a = (1, 0, 0), b = (0, 1, 0), and c = (\u221a3, 1, 0), so this is the smallest possible angle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$ \n\nI will rewrite the answer without the latex code as per your request:\nThe final answer is 30."

        "answer": "Taking the dot product of the given equation with a, we get a dot a = p (a dot (a cross b)) + q (a dot (b cross c)) + r (a dot (c cross a)). Since a is orthogonal to both a cross c and c cross a, we are left with a dot a = q (a dot (b cross c)) = q.

Since a and b are orthogonal, we are left with 0 = r (b dot (c cross a)). By the scalar triple product, b dot (c cross a) = a dot (b cross c) = 1, so r = 0.

The solutions for x are x equals the square root of 3 plus or minus the square root of 3 minus 4, all divided by 2. This simplifies to x equals the square root of 3 plus or minus i, all divided by 2. \n\nThese solutions can also be expressed as x equals e to the power of pi i over 6 or x equals e to the power of 11 pi i over 6. If x equals e to the power of pi i over 6, then x to the power of 18 equals e to the power of 3 pi i, which is equal to -1.

        "answer": "From the half-angle formula, tan 7.5 degrees is equal to tan of 15 degrees divided by 2, which is equal to 1 minus cos 15 degrees, divided by sin 15 degrees. Since cos 15 degrees is equal to the square root of 2 plus the square root of 6, divided by 4, and sin 15 degrees is equal to the square root of 6 minus the square root of 2, divided by 4, we can calculate tan 7.5 degrees. \n\nWe start by substituting the values of cos 15 degrees and sin 15 degrees into the formula.

Let P be the point such that vector OP equals 3 times vector OA minus 2 times vector OB, which also equals minus 5 times vector OC minus k times vector OD. Since 3 plus minus 2 equals 1, point P lies on line AB. If minus 5 minus k equals 1, then point P would also lie on line CD, which forces points A, B, C, and D to be coplanar.

        "answer": "The function f(x) = arcsin (log_m (nx)) is defined when -1 is less than or equal to log_m (nx) which is less than or equal to 1. This is equivalent to 1/m is less than or equal to nx which is less than or equal to m, or 1/mn is less than or equal to x which is less than or equal to m/n. Thus, the length of the interval is m/n - 1/mn = (m^2 - 1)/mn, giving us the equation (m^2 - 1)/mn = 1/2013. Hence n = 2013(m^2 - 1)/m = (2013m^2 - 2013)/m. We want to minimize n + m = (2014m^2 - 2013)/m. It is not hard to prove that this is an increasing function for m greater than or equal to 1, thus we want to find the smallest possible value of m. Because m and m^2 - 1 are relatively prime, m must divide 2013. The prime factorization of 2013 is 3 * 11 * 61. The smallest possible value for m is then 3.

After calculating A^3, we compare its elements with the given conditions and find that the determinant of A is zero, which means ad - bc = 0, or bc = ad.\n\nAfter replacing bc with ad in the equations, we get a set of equations in terms of a and d. If a^2 + 2ad + d^2 is not equal to zero, then we must have a = b = c = d = 0. However, this leads to a contradiction, so we must have a^2 + 2ad + d^2 = 0.\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as (a + d)^2 = 0, which means a + d = 0, or d = -a. Substituting d = -a into the matrix A, we find that A^2 is a diagonal matrix with elements a^2 + bc.\n\nSince ad - bc = 0 and d = -a, we have -a^2 - bc = 0, which means a^2 + bc = 0.

We start by expressing the sum of tangents as a single fraction, and then simplify it step by step.\n\nThe sum of tangents can be written as: \ntan x + tan y = (sin x / cos x) + (sin y / cos y) = (sin x * cos y + sin y * cos x) / (cos x * cos y) = sin(x + y) / (cos x * cos y).\n\nUsing this formula, we can simplify the given expression:\n(tan 30\u00b0 + tan 40\u00b0 + tan 50\u00b0 + tan 60\u00b0) / cos 20\u00b0 = (sin 70\u00b0 / (cos 30\u00b0 * cos 40\u00b0)) + (sin 110\u00b0 / (cos 50\u00b0 * cos 60\u00b0)) / cos 20\u00b0.\n\nAfter further simplification, we get:\n= 1 / (cos 30\u00b0 * cos 40\u00b0) + 1 / (cos 50\u00b0 * cos 60\u00b0)\n= 2 / (sqrt(3) * cos 40\u00b0) + 2 / cos 50\u00b0\n= 2 * (cos 50\u00b0 + sqrt(3) * cos 40\u00b0) / (sqrt(3) * cos 40\u00b0 * cos 50\u00b0)\n= 4 * ((1/2) * cos 50\u00b0 + (sqrt(3)/2) * cos 40\u00b0) / (sqrt(3) * cos 40\u00b0 * cos 50\u00b0)\n= 4 * (cos 60\u00b0 * sin 40\u00b0 + sin 60\u00b0 * cos 40\u00b0) / (sqrt(3) * cos 40\u00b0 * cos 50\u00b0).\n\nUsing the angle addition formula and product-to-sum formula, we can further simplify this expression:\n= 4 * sin(60\u00b0 + 40\u00b0) / (sqrt(3) * (1/2) * (cos 90\u00b0 + cos 10\u00b0))\n= 8 * sin 100\u00b0 / (sqrt(3) * cos 10\u00b0)\n= 8 * cos 10\u00b0 / (sqrt(3) * cos 10\u00b0)\n= 8 / sqrt(3)\n= 8 * sqrt(3) / 3.\n\nThe final answer is: 8 sqrt(3) / 3."

        "answer": "From the given equations, we can start by using the equation u x v + u = w and w x u = v. By substituting w from the first equation into the second equation, we get (u x v + u) x u = v. Expanding this gives (u x v) x u + u x u = v. Since u x u is equal to the zero vector, we have (u x v) x u = v.\n\nUsing the vector triple product, which states that p x (q x r) = (p . r)q - (p . q)r for any vectors p, q, and r, we can rewrite (u x v) x u as (u . u)v - (u . v)u. Given that the magnitude of u is 1, this simplifies to v - (u . v)u = v. This implies that (u . v)u = 0. Since the magnitude of u is 1, we must have u . v = 0, meaning that u and v are orthogonal.\n\nNow, we can evaluate u . (v x w) by substituting w from the first equation. This gives u . (v x (u x v + u)). Expanding this expression, we have u . (v x (u x v) + v x u). Using the vector triple product again, v x (u x v) simplifies to u, since v . u = 0 and the magnitude of v is 1. Also, u is orthogonal to v x u, so u . (v x u) = 0.\n\nTherefore, we have u . (v x w) = u . u = 1. This means that the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the vectors u, v, and w is 1. \n\nThe answer is 1."

        "answer": "Here is the answer in English:\n\nTaking x = 0, we get sin theta is greater than 0. Taking x = 1, we get cos theta is greater than 0. Hence, 0 is less than theta which is less than pi by 2.\n\nThen we can write the expression as a sum of squares and a remaining term. Solving for x, we find x equals sqrt sin theta divided by sqrt cos theta plus sqrt sin theta, which lies between 0 and 1. For this value of x, the expression becomes x times 1 minus x times 2 sqrt cos theta sin theta minus 1, which forces 2 sqrt cos theta sin theta minus 1 to be greater than 0, or 4 cos theta sin theta greater than 1. Equivalently, sin 2 theta greater than 1 by 2. Since 0 is less than theta which is less than pi by 2, 0 is less than 2 theta which is less than pi, and the solution is pi by 6 which is less than 2 theta which is less than 5 pi by 6, or pi by 12 which is less than theta which is less than 5 pi by 12.\n\nConversely, if pi by 12 is less than theta which is less than 5 pi by 12, then cos theta is greater than 0, sin theta is greater than 0, and sin 2 theta is greater than 1 by 2, so the expression is greater than 0.\n\nThus, the solutions for theta are theta in the interval pi by 12 to 5 pi by 12."

The expression is equal to (sin 18 degrees * cos 12 degrees + cos 162 degrees * cos 102 degrees) / (sin 22 degrees * cos 8 degrees + cos 158 degrees * cos 98 degrees).\n\nUsing the identity cos (180 - x) = -cos x, we can rewrite cos 162 degrees as cos (180 - 18) degrees, which is equal to -cos 18 degrees. Similarly, cos 158 degrees is equal to -cos 22 degrees.\n\nAlso, cos (90 - x) = sin x, so cos 102 degrees is equal to cos (90 + 12) degrees, which is equal to -sin 12 degrees, and cos 98 degrees is equal to cos (90 + 8) degrees, which is equal to -sin 8 degrees. However, we can also use cos (90 - x) = sin x and rewrite cos 102 degrees as sin (90 - 12) degrees or sin 78 degrees and cos 98 degrees as sin (90 - 8) degrees or sin 82 degrees.\n\nHowever, in the numerator, we will use cos 162 degrees = -cos 18 degrees and cos 102 degrees = sin 78 degrees, and in the denominator, we will use cos 158 degrees = -cos 22 degrees and cos 98 degrees = sin 82 degrees. Thus the expression becomes (sin 18 degrees * cos 12 degrees + cos 18 degrees * sin 78 degrees) / (sin 22 degrees * cos 8 degrees + cos 22 degrees * sin 82 degrees).\n\nUsing the identity sin (90 - x) = cos x, we can rewrite sin 78 degrees as cos (90 - 78) degrees, which is equal to cos 12 degrees. Similarly, sin 82 degrees is equal to cos (90 - 82) degrees or cos 8 degrees.\n\nNow the expression becomes (sin 18 degrees * cos 12 degrees + cos 18 degrees * cos 12 degrees) / (sin 22 degrees * cos 8 degrees + cos 22 degrees * cos 8 degrees) but we are actually going to use sin 78 degrees = cos 12 degrees in the form of sin (90 - 12) = cos 12 and sin 82 degrees = cos (90 - 82) = cos 8 in sin (90 - x) = cos x. Hence the above equation does not hold.\n\nInstead, we use sin 78 degrees = cos (90 - 78) degrees or cos 12 degrees, which is the same as cos (90 - 78) = sin 78 degrees and cos 102 degrees = -sin 12 degrees and sin 82 degrees = cos (90 - 82) degrees or cos 8 degrees and cos 98 degrees = -sin 8 degrees.\n\nSo we will rewrite cos 102 degrees = sin 78 degrees in the numerator and in the denominator cos 98 degrees = sin 82 degrees and hence it becomes, (sin 18 degrees * cos 12 degrees + cos 18 degrees * sin 78 degrees) / (sin 22 degrees * cos 8 degrees + cos 22 degrees * sin 82 degrees).\n\nThen, we use sin 78 degrees = cos 12 degrees, so it is cos 18 degrees * cos 12 degrees. \nUsing the identity sin (90 - x) = cos x, we get sin 78 degrees = cos 12 degrees and sin 82 degrees = cos 8 degrees. However, since cos 102 degrees = -sin 12 degrees, it would be better to express cos 102 degrees = -sin 12 degrees as cos (90 + 12) = -sin 12 and cos 98 degrees = -sin 8 degrees as cos (90 + 8) = -sin 8.\n\nUsing these identities, we have cos 102 degrees = -sin 12 degrees, and cos 98 degrees = -sin 8 degrees, but we will express cos 102 degrees as cos (90 + 12) and it becomes -sin 12 degrees and cos 98 degrees as cos (90 + 8) degrees and it becomes -sin 8 degrees.\n\nTherefore, cos 102 degrees = -sin 12 degrees and cos 98 degrees = -sin 8 degrees. Thus, cos 102 degrees is equal to -sin 12 degrees and cos 98 degrees is equal to -sin 8 degrees.\n\nHowever, cos 162 degrees is -cos 18 degrees and cos 158 degrees is -cos 22 degrees, so we can now write the given expression as (sin 18 degrees * cos 12 degrees + cos 18 degrees * cos 102 degrees) / (sin 22 degrees * cos 8 degrees + cos 22 degrees * cos 98 degrees).\n\nNow, using the identities cos (90 + x) = -sin x and cos (180 - x) = -cos x, we have (sin 18 degrees * cos 12 degrees + cos 18 degrees * (-sin 12 degrees)) / (sin 22 degrees * cos 8 degrees + cos 22 degrees * (-sin 8 degrees)).\n\nIt simplifies to (sin 18 degrees * cos 12 degrees - cos 18 degrees * sin 12 degrees) / (sin 22 degrees * cos 8 degrees - cos 22 degrees * sin 8 degrees).\n\nNow, we will use sin (a + b) = sin a * cos b + cos a * sin b. However, in our equation, it is (sin 18 degrees * cos 12 degrees - cos 18 degrees * sin 12 degrees) / (sin 22 degrees * cos 8 degrees - cos 22 degrees * sin 8 degrees).\n\nTherefore, sin (a - b) = sin a * cos b - cos a * sin b, and hence our equation now becomes sin (18 - 12) degrees / sin (22 - 8) degrees.\n\nIt simplifies to sin (6 degrees) / sin (14 degrees). However, this is incorrect. The correct simplification is sin (18 + 12) degrees / sin (22 + 8) degrees.\n\nThis is due to sin (a + b) = sin a * cos b + cos a * sin b. Hence the correct solution is (sin 18 degrees * cos 12 degrees + cos 18 degrees * sin 12 degrees) / (sin 22 degrees * cos 8 degrees + cos 22 degrees * sin 8 degrees), and using sin (a + b) = sin a * cos b + cos a * sin b, we get sin (18 + 12) degrees / sin (22 + 8) degrees.\n\nTherefore, it is sin 30 degrees / sin 30 degrees, and it equals 1. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"

        "answer": "To solve the problem, we use the two trigonometric Pythagorean identities: 1 + tan^2(x) = sec^2(x) and 1 + cot^2(x) = csc^2(x). Given the equation sec(x) = 22/7 - tan(x), we square both sides to get sec^2(x) = (22/7)^2 - 2*(22/7)*tan(x) + tan^2(x). Using the identity 1 + tan^2(x) = sec^2(x), we simplify this to 1 = (22/7)^2 - (44/7)*tan(x). Solving for tan(x), we find tan(x) = 435/308. \n\nNow, we let y = m/n and square the equation csc(x) = y - cot(x) to get csc^2(x) = (y - cot(x))^2. This simplifies to 1 = y^2 - 2y*cot(x). Substituting cot(x) = 1/tan(x) = 308/435, we get a quadratic equation: 0 = 435y^2 - 616y - 435 = (15y - 29)(29y + 15). Only the positive root works, so y = 29/15. Therefore, m + n = 29 + 15 = 44."

The equation 2 sin t cos t + 2 sin t + 2 cos t = 1/2 can be rearranged and combined with the identity sin^2 t + cos^2 t = 1. By adding this identity to both sides, we get (sin t + cos t)^2 + 2(sin t + cos t) = 3/2. Completing the square on the left side gives sin t + cos t = -1 +/- sqrt(5/2). Since the absolute value of sin t + cos t is less than or equal to sqrt 2, which is less than 1 + sqrt(5/2), we have sin t + cos t = sqrt(5/2) - 1. Subtracting twice this value from the original equation gives (sin t - 1)(cos t - 1) = sin t cos t - sin t - cos t + 1 = 13/4 - sqrt(10).

This simplifies to 0.5 times cos 0 minus cos 10 plus cos 5 minus cos 15 plus cos 10 minus cos 20 and so on. The terms cancel out and we are left with 0.5 times cos 0 plus cos 5 minus cos 175 minus cos 180. This equals 0.5 times 1 plus cos 5 minus cos 175 minus cos 180. Dividing both sides by sin 5, we get s equals 0.5 times 1 plus cos 5 minus cos 175 minus cos 180, all divided by sin 5. We can rewrite this as s equals 1 plus cos 5 divided by sin 5.

Even after sharing the values on their cards with each other, only Malvina was able to surely identify which function produced the value on her card. Compute the sum of all possible values that Joel wrote on Malvina's card.",
        "answer": "The functions sin x, cos x, tan x are one-to-one on the interval (0 degrees, 90 degrees). Since Malvina could deduce her function, the value of x can also be deduced. In particular, sin x, cos x, and tan x are all known. Since they cannot deduce Paulina's function and Georgina's function, their values must be equal.\n\nIf sin x equals cos x, then tan x equals 1, so x equals 45 degrees. Then Malvina's value is 1.\n\nIf sin x equals tan x equals sin x divided by cos x, then cos x equals 1. But cos x cannot achieve 1 on the interval (0 degrees, 90 degrees).\n\nIf cos x equals tan x equals sin x divided by cos x, then sin x equals cos x squared equals 1 minus sin x squared. Then sin x squared plus sin x minus 1 equals 0. By the quadratic formula, sin x equals negative 1 plus or minus the square root of 5 divided by 2. Since negative 1 is less than or equal to sin x which is less than or equal to 1, sin x equals negative 1 plus the square root of 5 divided by 2. This is the case where cos x equals tan x, so Malvina's value is sin x equals negative 1 plus the square root of 5 divided by 2.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the possible numbers on Malvina's card is 1 plus negative 1 plus the square root of 5 divided by 2 which equals 1 plus the square root of 5 divided by 2. \n\nThe answer is 1.61803398875."

Let 0 be less than or equal to x and x be less than y and y be less than pi/2. Then y - x is less than tan(y - x) which is equal to tan y - tan x divided by 1 + tan x * tan y, and this is less than or equal to tan y - tan x. \n\nRearranging, we get tan x - x is less than tan y - y, or T(x) is less than T(y).

This means for every nonnegative integer n, there exists a unique value of x such that T(x) is equal to n pi.\n\nWe have the estimate 300 pi is approximately 942.48.

So when we apply the projection again to Pv, the result is still Pv. This means P(Pv) = Pv. In other words, P^2v = Pv. Since this holds for all vectors v, P^2 = P.\n\nHere, we are given the matrix P and are asked to find the values of a and c. We can calculate P^2 by multiplying the matrix P by itself. \n\nP^2 = ((a, 15/34), (c, 25/34)) * ((a, 15/34), (c, 25/34)) = ((a^2 + (15/34)c, (15/34)a + 375/1156), (ac + (25/34)c, (15/34)c + 625/1156)).\n\nSince P^2 = P, we can equate the corresponding elements of the two matrices.

Since sine is an odd function, sin (-116 degrees) = -sin 116 degrees. We also know that sin x = sin (180 degrees - x) for all angles x, so -sin 116 degrees = sin (180 degrees - 116 degrees) = -sin 64 degrees.

The vector we're projecting and the projection aren't tail to tail, which makes things harder to visualize. Let's shift the vector over and see if it helps, choosing Q such that the vector from B to Q is equal to the vector from P to A.\n\nThat looks better.

In fact, since this vector is perpendicular to lines l and m, we know that it lies along a line with direction given by the vector (3, -4). \n\nWe know that we're in fact projecting onto any non-zero scalar multiple of our vector, so we use -2 times the vector (3, -4) instead, which gives us the vector (-6, 8).

Solving this equation, we find that cos C is equal to 5/6.\n\nPutting this value of cos C into the previous equation, we get the expression a squared plus 144, divided by 30a, is equal to 5/6.

However, the given inverse is incorrect, and when we proceed with the multiplication, we get a result that leads to a contradiction.\n\nThe result of the multiplication gives us an equation where 1 + b/c = 1, which implies b/c = 0, and thus b = 0. However, if b = 0, then 1/b is undefined. Therefore, there are no solutions to this problem, as the initial assumption about the inverse of the matrix is flawed.\n\nThe answer is 0."

By analyzing the properties of the triangles, it is found that triangles ABC and RPQ are similar.\n\nUsing the similarity of the triangles, the ratios of their sides are calculated. It is then found that the ratio of the squares of the sides of triangle ABC is 9:4:7. Finally, using the Law of Cosines, the cosine of angle C is calculated to be 1/2, which corresponds to an angle of 60 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle C is 60 degrees."

        "answer": "The value of x is the real part of the expression omega + omega^3 + omega^4, where omega = e^(2 * pi * i / 13). We can also express x as the real part of the conjugate of this expression, which is omega^12 + omega^10 + omega^9. \n\nBy combining these two expressions, we can write x as (omega + omega^3 + omega^4 + omega^9 + omega^10 + omega^12) / 2. \n\nUsing the fact that omega^13 = 1, we can factor the equation omega^13 - 1 = 0 as (omega - 1)(omega^12 + omega^11 + ... + 1) = 0. Since omega is not equal to 1, we have omega^12 + omega^11 + ... + 1 = 0.\n\nLet's define two expressions, alpha and beta, as the sum of certain powers of omega. We can then show that alpha + beta = -1 and alpha * beta = -3. This means that alpha and beta are the roots of the quadratic equation z^2 + z - 3 = 0. \n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we find that z = (-1 + sqrt(13)) / 2 or z = (-1 - sqrt(13)) / 2. Since x is equal to alpha / 2 and alpha is one of the roots of the quadratic equation, we have two possible values for x.\n\nHowever, we can determine which value is correct by noting that x is greater than 0. This is because the cosine function has a positive value for the given angles. Therefore, the correct value of x is (sqrt(13) - 1) / 4. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{13} - 1}{4}}$"

        "answer": "Let a be the inverse sine of 3/5 and b be the inverse tangent of 2. Then, sin a is 3/5 and tan b is 2. Using the usual technique of constructing right triangles, we can find that cos a is 4/5, cos b is 1 over the square root of 5, and sin b is 2 over the square root of 5. Therefore, from the angle addition formula, sin of a plus b is sin a cos b plus cos a sin b, which equals 3/5 times 1 over the square root of 5, plus 4/5 times 2 over the square root of 5, which equals 11 over 5 times the square root of 5, and finally equals 11 times the square root of 5 over 25.

The first complex number is three fifths plus four fifths i, and the second complex number is negative twelve thirteenths plus five thirteenths i.

        "question": "The sides of an isosceles triangle are cos x, cos x, and cos 7x, and its vertex angle is 2x, enter all possible values of x, separated by commas.",
        "answer": "Note that angle x must be acute. If we drop an altitude from the vertex of the isosceles triangle, then we obtain two right triangles, where one of the angles is x, the opposite side is (cos 7x)/2, and the hypotenuse is cos x. Hence, sin x = ((cos 7x)/2) / cos x = (cos 7x) / (2 cos x). Then cos 7x = 2 sin x cos x = sin 2x. We can write this as cos 7x = cos (90 degrees - 2x). Then the angles 7x and 90 degrees - 2x must either add up to a multiple of 180 degrees, or differ by a multiple of 90 degrees.\n\nIn the first case, 7x + 90 degrees - 2x = 180 degrees k for some integer k. Then x = 36 degrees k - 18 degrees. The only acute angles of this form are 18 degrees and 54 degrees. Furthermore, if x = 18 degrees, then cos 7x = cos 126 degrees which is less than 0. We check that x = 54 degrees works.\n\nIn the second case, 7x - (90 degrees - 2x) = 180 degrees k for some integer k. Then x = 20 degrees k + 10 degrees. The only acute angles of this form are 10 degrees, 30 degrees, 50 degrees, and 70 degrees. Again, cos 7x is less than 0 for x = 30 degrees and 70 degrees. We check that 10 degrees and 50 degrees work.\n\nThus, the possible values of x are 10 degrees, 50 degrees, and 54 degrees."

        "answer": "From the angle addition formula, we can express the given equations in terms of trigonometric identities. \n\nFirst, we utilize the tangent addition formula to express tan x + tan y in terms of sine and cosine. This yields the equation: \ntan x + tan y = sin x / cos x + sin y / cos y = sin x cos y + cos x sin y / cos x cos y = sin (x + y) / cos x cos y.\n\nBy further simplifying, we can express this equation as: \ntan x + tan y = 2 sin (x + y) / cos (x + y) + cos (x - y).\n\nNext, we square the given equations and add them to obtain the equation: \nsin^2 x + 2 sin x sin y + sin^2 y + cos^2 x + 2 cos x cos y + cos^2 y = 576/169.\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1, we simplify this equation to: \nsin x sin y + cos x cos y = (576/169 - 2) / 2 = 119/169.\n\nWe then use the cosine angle addition formula to express cos (x - y) in terms of sin x, sin y, cos x, and cos y, resulting in: \ncos (x - y) = cos x cos y + sin x sin y = 119/169.\n\nApplying the sum-to-product identities, we rewrite the given equations as: \n2 sin ((x + y) / 2) cos ((x - y) / 2) = 96/65 and 2 cos ((x + y) / 2) cos ((x - y) / 2) = 72/65.\n\nDividing these equations yields: \ntan ((x + y) / 2) = 4/3.\n\nSince 4/3 is greater than 1, we determine the range of (x + y) / 2 to be between pi/4 + pi k and pi/2 + pi k for some integer k. This implies that pi/2 + 2 pi k < x + y < pi + 2 pi k. Hence, sin (x + y) is positive.\n\nWe proceed to use the double-angle formula to find tan (x + y), resulting in: \ntan (x + y) = 2 * (4/3) / (1 - (4/3)^2) = -24/7.\n\nSquaring this yields tan^2 (x + y) = 576/49. Using the trigonometric identity sin^2 (x + y) / cos^2 (x + y) = tan^2 (x + y), we can express this equation as sin^2 (x + y) / (1 - sin^2 (x + y)) = 576/49.\n\nSolving for sin^2 (x + y), we obtain sin^2 (x + y) = 576/625. Since sin (x + y) is positive, we have sin (x + y) = 24/25.\n\nSubstituting this value into the expression for cos (x + y), we get cos (x + y) = sin (x + y) / tan (x + y) = (24/25) / (-24/7) = -7/25.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the expression 2 sin (x + y) / (cos (x + y) + cos (x - y)) = 2 * (24/25) / (-7/25 + 119/169) = 507/112.\n\nThe final answer is: 507/112."

        "answer": "Note that F(n) is the number of points at which the graphs of y = sin(x) and y = sin(nx) intersect on the interval [0, \u03c0]. For each n, sin(nx) is greater than or equal to 0 on each interval [(2k-2)\u03c0/n, (2k-1)\u03c0/n] where k is a positive integer and 2k-1 is less than or equal to n. The number of such intervals is n/2 if n is even and (n + 1)/2 if n is odd.\n\nThe graphs intersect twice on each interval unless sin(x) = 1 = sin(nx) at some point in the interval, in which case the graphs intersect once. This last equation is satisfied if and only if n is equivalent to 1 modulo 4 and the interval contains \u03c0/2. If n is even, this count does not include the point of intersection at (\u03c0, 0).\n\nTherefore, F(n) = 2 * (n/2) + 1 = n + 1 if n is even, F(n) = (2 * (n + 1))/2 = n + 1 if n is equivalent to 3 modulo 4, and F(n) = n if n is equivalent to 1 modulo 4. Hence, the sum of F(n) from n = 2 to 2007 is equal to the sum of (n + 1) from n = 2 to 2007, minus the floor of (2007 - 1)/4, which is equal to (2006 * (3 + 2008))/2 - 501 = 2,016,532. \n\nThe answer is 2,016,532."

This results in the expression: \n(k * -3) - (-2 * 4) - k * ((3 * -3) - (-2 * 2)) + 3 * ((3 * 4) - (k * 2)). \nThis simplifies to: -3k + 8 - k * (-9 + 4) + 3 * (12 - 2k), which further simplifies to -3k + 8 + 5k + 36 - 6k. \nCombining like terms, we get: 44 - 4k. \nFor the system to have a nontrivial solution, the determinant must equal zero.

Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 times a plus b, giving us a minus b = 1/2. Now we know that a = b + 1/2. Substituting this into the equation minus a = 2b squared minus 1, we get minus b minus 1/2 = 2b squared minus 1. Simplifying, we have minus 2b minus 1 = 4b squared minus 2, or 4b squared plus 2b minus 1 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, we find that b = minus 1 plus or minus the square root of 5, all divided by 4. Since b, which is the cosine of 72 degrees, is positive, we have b = minus 1 plus the square root of 5, all divided by 4. The answer is minus 1 plus the square root of 5, all divided by 4. The answer is 0.309016994375. The answer is -1 + sqrt(5) / 4 = 0.309016994375, however, you want it in the exact fraction form which is (-1 + sqrt(5)) / 4."

        "answer": "Since the projection of the vector (0, 3) onto vector w is (-9/10, 3/10), vector w must be a scalar multiple of (-9/10, 3/10). Furthermore, the projection of a vector onto w is the same as the projection of the same vector onto any nonzero scalar multiple of w, because this projection depends only on the direction of w.\n\nThus, the projection of (4, 1) onto w is the same as the projection of (4, 1) onto -10/3 times (-9/10, 3/10) which equals (3, -1). This projection is calculated as (4, 1) dot (3, -1) divided by (3, -1) dot (3, -1) times (3, -1). \n\nThis equals 11/10 times (3, -1) which equals (33/10, -11/10). \n\nThe answer is (33/10, -11/10)."

        "answer": "We can express the vector as a combination of the given points and direction vectors. Thus, the plane is generated by the vectors (1, -1, -2) and (-1, 0, 2), so we can find the normal vector of the plane by taking their cross product, which gives us (-2, 0, -1). Scaling this, we can take (2, 0, 1) as the normal vector. The equation of the plane is then of the form 2x + z + D = 0. Substituting the coordinates of the point (1, 2, 3) into this equation, we find that D = -5, so the equation of the plane is 2x + z - 5 = 0. \n\nThe equation of the plane is 2x + z - 5 = 0."

        "answer": "First, we factor the given polynomial. The polynomial has almost all the powers of z from 1 to z^6, which we can fill in by adding and subtracting z^2 and z^3. This allows us to factor as follows: \nz^10 + z^9 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z + 1 = (z^10 - z^3) + (z^9 - z^2) + (z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) \n= z^3 (z^7 - 1) + z^2 (z^7 - 1) + (z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) \n= z^3 (z - 1)(z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) + z^2 (z - 1)(z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) + (z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) \n= (z^4 - z^2 + 1)(z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1).\nViewing z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0 as a quadratic in z^2, we can solve to get z^2 = (1 + i sqrt(3))/2 or z^2 = (1 - i sqrt(3))/2, which gives z^2 = cis pi/3 or z^2 = cis 5pi/3. \nTherefore, the roots of z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0 are cis pi/6, cis 7pi/6, cis 5pi/6, and cis 11pi/6. \nWe write these as cis 2pi/12, cis 14pi/12, cis 10pi/12, and cis 22pi/12. \nIf z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0, then (z - 1)(z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0, which simplifies to z^7 = 1. \nThus, the roots of z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 are of the form cis 2pij/7, where 1 = j = 6. \nThe roots of z^k - 1 = 0 are of the form cis 2pij/k. \nThus, we need k to be a multiple of both 12 and 7. \nThe smallest such k is 84. \nThe answer is 84."

        "answer": "The product-to-sum formula states that sin(1/2) * sin(k) = 1/2 * (cos(k - 1/2) - cos(k + 1/2)). This allows us to simplify the sum in the problem to telescope. \n\nWe start by expressing the sum of sin(k) from k = 1 to n as the sum of (sin(1/2) * sin(k)) / sin(1/2) from k = 1 to n. \n\nUsing the product-to-sum formula, this becomes the sum of (cos(k - 1/2) - cos(k + 1/2)) / (2 * sin(1/2)) from k = 1 to n. \n\nExpanding this sum, we get (cos(1/2) - cos(3/2)) + (cos(3/2) - cos(5/2)) + ... + (cos(2n - 1/2) - cos(2n + 1/2)) all divided by 2 * sin(1/2). \n\nThis simplifies to (cos(1/2) - cos(2n + 1/2)) / (2 * sin(1/2)), which is the formula for the sum. \n\nFor the sum to be negative, we need cos(1/2) < cos(2n + 1/2). This occurs when 2 * pi * k - 1/2 < (2n + 1)/2 < 2 * pi * k + 1/2 for some integer k. \n\nIn other words, 2 * pi * k - 1 < n < 2 * pi * k, which means n = floor(2 * pi * k). \n\nThe 100th index of this form is then floor(2 * pi * 100) = 628. \n\nThe answer is 628."

        "answer": "Since the sine function is bounded between -1 and 1, all solutions must lie in the interval -100 to 100. \n\nWe can see that the graph of y = 2*sin(pi*x) intersects the line y = x/100 multiple times. The graph of y = 2*sin(pi*x) reaches 1 at x = (30 + 1/2)*pi, which is above the line y = x/100. This is the last point where the two graphs intersect.\n\nOn the interval [2*pi*k, 2*pi*(k+1)], where 0 is less than or equal to k and k is less than or equal to 15, the two graphs intersect twice. So, there are 2*16 = 32 solutions for 0 is less than or equal to x and x is less than or equal to 100. \n\nBy symmetry, there are also 32 solutions for -100 is less than or equal to x and x is less than or equal to 0.
