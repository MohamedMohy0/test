        "question": "Shown below are rows 1, 2, and 3 of Pascal's triangle. \n\nLet the sequences from left to right of elements in the 2005th, 2006th, and 2007th rows be denoted as (a_i), (b_i), and (c_i) respectively, where the leftmost element is at i = 0. \n\nWe are asked to compute the difference between the sum of b_i divided by c_i from i = 0 to 2006, and the sum of a_i divided by b_i from i = 0 to 2005.",
        "answer": "More generally, suppose the entries in rows n - 1, n, n + 1 of Pascal's triangle are represented by (a_i), (b_i), (c_i) respectively. Then a_i equals the binomial coefficient n - 1 choose i, b_i equals the binomial coefficient n choose i, and c_i equals the binomial coefficient n + 1 choose i. \n\nThe ratio of a_i to b_i is calculated as the binomial coefficient n - 1 choose i divided by the binomial coefficient n choose i. This is equivalent to the fraction (n - 1) factorial times (n - i) factorial divided by n factorial times (n - i - 1) factorial. \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get (n - i) divided by n, which equals 1 minus the fraction i divided by n. \n\nHence, the sum of the ratio of a_i to b_i for i ranging from 0 to n - 1 is equal to the sum of 1 minus the fraction i divided by n for i ranging from 0 to n - 1. \n\nThis sum simplifies to n minus the fraction (n - 1) times n divided by 2 times n, which equals n minus the fraction n - 1 divided by 2. This further simplifies to the fraction n + 1 divided by 2. \n\nSimilarly, the ratio of b_i to c_i equals 1 minus the fraction i divided by n + 1. The sum of the ratio of b_i to c_i for i ranging from 0 to n equals the fraction n + 2 divided by 2. \n\nTherefore, the difference between the sum of the ratio of b_i to c_i for i ranging from 0 to n and the sum of the ratio of a_i to b_i for i ranging from 0 to n - 1 equals the fraction n + 2 divided by 2 minus the fraction n + 1 divided by 2, which equals 1/2. \n\nThe answer is 1/2."

        "answer": "We complete the square with respect to the terms b squared and b over a, to get b squared plus b over a equals open bracket b plus one over two a close bracket squared minus one over four a squared. This is minimized when b equals negative one over two a. The problem now is to minimize a squared plus one over a squared minus one over four a squared equals a squared plus three over four a squared. We can assume that a is positive. Then by AM-GM, a squared plus three over four a squared is greater than or equal to two times the square root of a squared times three over four a squared equals square root of three. Equality occurs when a equals fourth root of three over four, so the minimum value is square root of three."

        "question": "The increasing sequence of positive integers has the property that each term after the first two is the sum of the two preceding terms. If the seventh term is 120, find the eighth term.",
        "answer": "Here is the solution in English:\n\nWe are given a sequence where the first two terms are a and b. The subsequent terms are defined as follows:\na3 = a + b\na4 = a + 2b\na5 = 2a + 3b\na6 = 3a + 5b\na7 = 5a + 8b\na8 = 8a + 13b\n\nWe know that a7 = 5a + 8b = 120. Rearranging this equation, we get 5a = 120 - 8b = 8(15 - b). Since 5 and 8 are relatively prime, a must be divisible by 8.\n\nLet's try different values of a that are divisible by 8. If a = 8, then b = 10. If a = 16, then b = 5, but this does not work because the sequence is increasing and b must be greater than a. We can see that higher values of b result in lower values of a, so the only possible value of a is 8. Substituting a = 8 into the equation for a8, we get a8 = 8a + 13b = 8(8) + 13(10) = 64 + 130 = 194.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 194."

        "answer": "In the coordinate plane, let point A be at coordinates (0,1), point B be at coordinates (1,-1), and point P be at coordinates (x,x). The distance between points A and P is given by the formula AP = square root of (x squared + (1 - x) squared), and the distance between points B and P is given by the formula BP = square root of ((x - 1) squared + (x + 1) squared). We want to minimize the sum of AP and BP, with the condition that P lies on the line y = x.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Triangle Inequality, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side. In this case, the triangle is formed by points A, B, and P. The distance between points A and B is given by the formula AB = square root of 5.\n\nUsing the Triangle Inequality, we can write AP + BP >= AB = square root of 5. This means that the minimum value of AP + BP is equal to the distance between points A and B, which is square root of 5. This minimum value occurs when point P is the intersection of the line y = x and the line AB, which happens when x = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of AP + BP is square root of 5."

Then, (x + square root of 2) times ((x + square root of 2) squared plus 1) equals 0, so x equals negative square root of 2 or (x + square root of 2) squared equals negative 1.

Since those two terms are m-1 terms apart, we have a_(m-1) * a_m - a_0 * a_1 = 0 - 37 * 72 = -3 * (m-1), so m = 37 * 24 + 1 = 889. The answer is 889."

        "answer": "We can assume that the ellipse is tangent to the circle (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1. From this equation, y^2 = 1 - (x - 1)^2. Substituting into the equation of the ellipse, we get (x^2/a^2) + (1 - (x - 1)^2)/b^2 = 1. This simplifies to (a^2 - b^2)x^2 - 2a^2x + a^2b^2 = 0. \n\nBy symmetry, the x-coordinates of both tangent points will be equal, so the discriminant of this quadratic will be 0: (2a^2)^2 - 4(a^2 - b^2)(a^2b^2) = 0. This simplifies to a^4b^2 = a^4 + a^2b^4. We can divide both sides by a^2 to get a^2b^2 = a^2 + b^4. Then a^2 = b^4 / (b^2 - 1).\n\nThe area of the ellipse is piab. Minimizing this is equivalent to minimizing ab, which in turn is equivalent to minimizing a^2b^2 = b^6 / (b^2 - 1). Let t = b^2, so b^6 / (b^2 - 1) = t^3 / (t - 1). Then let u = t - 1. Then t = u + 1, so t^3 / (t - 1) = (u + 1)^3 / u = u^2 + 3u + 3 + 1/u.\n\nBy the AM-GM inequality, u^2 + 3u + 1/u is greater than or equal to 3 * (u * u * u * 1/u)^(1/3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6, and also greater than or equal to (1/4) * (4u^2) + 3u + 1/u, which is greater than or equal to 4 * (4u^2 * u * 1/u)^(1/4) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7, but most importantly, u^2 + 3u + 1/u is greater than or equal to 15 * (u^2 * u^6 * 1/(8^8u^8))^(1/15) = 15/4.\n\nEquality occurs when u = 1/2. For this value of u, t = 3/2, b = sqrt(3/2) = sqrt(6)/2, and a = 3*sqrt(2)/2. Hence, k = ab = (3*sqrt(2)/2) * (sqrt(6)/2) = 3*sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe final answer is: 3*sqrt(3)/2."

        "answer": "Note that the sum of the elements in the set is 8. Let x be the sum of a, b, c, and d, so the sum of e, f, g, and h is 8 - x. Then the sum of the squares of these two sums can be expressed as x^2 + (8 - x)^2, which equals 2x^2 - 16x + 64, and this can be further simplified to 2(x - 4)^2 + 32, which is greater than or equal to 32.\n\nThe value of 32 can be attained if and only if x = 4. However, it may be assumed without loss of generality that a = 13, and no choice of b, c, and d gives a total of 4 for x. Thus (x - 4)^2 is greater than or equal to 1, and the sum of the squares of the two sums is greater than or equal to 2(x - 4)^2 + 32, which is greater than or equal to 34.\n\nA total of 34 can be attained by letting a, b, c, and d be distinct elements in the set {-7, -5, 2, 13}. Therefore, the minimum possible value of the sum of the squares of the two sums is 34."

There are 1004 even values of a, and for each value of a, b can take on any of the 2007-a integer values between 0 and 2006-a, inclusive. The value of c is then uniquely determined as 2006-a-b. \n\nThis results in a total number of terms equal to the sum of the first 1004 odd positive integers, which can be calculated as 1004 squared, or alternatively, by considering the total number of non-negative integer solutions of a+b+c=2006, and subtracting the number of terms for which b and c have opposite parity. \n\nBoth methods yield the same result, which is 1004 squared, equal to 1,008,016.

        "question": "There are 24 different complex numbers z such that z to the power of 24 equals 1. For how many of these is z to the power of 6 a real number?",
        "answer": "From z to the power of 24 equals 1, we have z to the power of 24 minus 1 equals 0. So, we can factor this equation as the product of two terms: z to the power of 12 plus 1, and z to the power of 12 minus 1, which equals 0. Then, we can further factor z to the power of 12 minus 1 as the product of two terms: z to the power of 6 plus 1, and z to the power of 6 minus 1. Thus, we have the equation: z to the power of 12 plus 1, multiplied by z to the power of 6 plus 1, and multiplied by z to the power of 6 minus 1, which equals 0. \n\nNow, let's analyze this equation. For six of the roots, z to the power of 6 equals minus 1. For another six roots, z to the power of 6 equals 1. And for the remaining twelve roots, the square of z to the power of 6 plus 1 equals 0. This implies that z to the power of 6 is not real. \n\nTherefore, for twelve of the roots, z to the power of 6 is real, which is our answer. The final answer is 12."

We are asked to find the product of the number of possible values of f of 4 and the sum of all possible values of f of 4.",
        "answer": "To solve this problem, we start by setting y = s - x, which gives us the equation f(x) + f(s - x) = f(x(s - x)f(s)). This equation holds for all x in S, except for x = s.\n\nWe then consider the equation s - x = x(s - x)f(s) and find its solutions. The solutions to this equation are x = s and x = 1/f(s). Since x is an element of S, f(s) is well-defined. Additionally, f(s) cannot be equal to 0, so 1/f(s) is also well-defined.\n\nIf f(s) is not equal to 1/s, we can substitute x = 1/f(s) into the equation f(x) + f(s - x) = f(x(s - x)f(s)). This gives us f(1/f(s)) + f(s - 1/f(s)) = f(s - 1/f(s)). From this, we get f(1/f(s)) = 0, which is a contradiction.\n\nThe only possible solution is f(s) = 1/s. In other words, f(x) = 1/x for all x in S. We can verify that this solution works, so n = 1 and s = 1/4. Therefore, the product of n and s is 1 * 1/4 = 1/4.\n\nThe final answer is: 1/4."

        "answer": "To try and write the given equation in standard form, we complete the square in each variable. The given equation is transformed into the standard form of an ellipse by completing the square for both x and y terms. The process involves adding and subtracting suitable constants to make each group of terms a perfect square. \n\nStarting with the given equation: (x^2 - 10x) + 4(y^2 + 14y) = k, we add and subtract constants to complete the square. For the x terms, we add and subtract (10/2)^2 = 25. For the y terms, we add and subtract (14/2)^2 = 49, but since this is multiplied by 4, we actually add and subtract 4 * 49 = 196. \n\nThis transforms the equation into: (x^2 - 10x + 25) + 4(y^2 + 14y + 49) = k + 25 + 196. Simplifying, we get (x - 5)^2 + 4(y + 7)^2 = k + 221.\n\nFor the equation to represent a non-degenerate ellipse, the right side must be greater than zero, because it represents the sum of squares, which should be positive for an ellipse. Thus, k + 221 > 0, implying k > -221.\n\nIf k + 221 = 0, the equation reduces to (x - 5)^2 + 4(y + 7)^2 = 0, which is only satisfied when x = 5 and y = -7, resulting in a single point.\n\nIf k + 221 < 0, there are no real solutions for x and y, as the sum of squares cannot be negative.\n\nTherefore, for the equation to represent a non-degenerate ellipse, k must be greater than -221. Thus, the value of a, which is the lower bound for k to have a non-degenerate ellipse, is -221."

        "answer": "We have the inequality 29 is less than or equal to x times the floor of x, which is less than 30. First, suppose that x is greater than or equal to 0. Then we have x times the floor of x is greater than or equal to the floor of x squared, so the floor of x squared is less than 30, and the floor of x is less than or equal to 5. Also, x times the floor of x is less than or equal to x squared, so 29 is less than or equal to x squared, which means that the floor of x is greater than or equal to 5. Thus, the floor of x is equal to 5, so the floor of 5x is equal to 29 from the original equation. Thus, 29 is less than or equal to 5x, which is less than 30, so 5.8 is less than or equal to x, which is less than 6. Indeed, if 5.8 is less than or equal to x, which is less than 6, then the floor of x times the floor of x is equal to the floor of 5x, which is equal to 29, so all x in the interval 5.8 to 6 are solutions to the equation.\n\nNow suppose that x is less than 0. Then we have x times the floor of x is less than or equal to the floor of x squared, so 29 is less than or equal to the floor of x squared, and the floor of x is less than or equal to -6. But then x is less than -5, so x times the floor of x is greater than or equal to -6x, which is greater than -6 times -5, which is equal to 30, a contradiction. Hence, no negative x satisfy the equation.\n\nThus, the solution set is the interval 5.8 to 6."

Therefore, a can only be 2, 1, -1, or -2.\n\nWhen we set x = -1, we get (a + 2) * p(-1) = 88, meaning that a + 2 must divide 88. Among the four possible values for a, only a = -1 and a = 2 satisfy this condition.\n\nIf a = -1, then x^2 - x + a becomes x^2 - x - 1 = 0, which has roots x = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 and x = (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2. One root is positive, and one root is negative. However, x^13 + x + 90 is always positive for positive x, meaning it cannot have any positive roots. Therefore, a cannot be -1.\n\nThis means a must be 2. By performing long division, we can verify that x^13 + x + 90 = (x^2 - x + 2) * (x^11 + x^10 - x^9 - 3x^8 - x^7 + 5x^6 + 7x^5 - 3x^4 - 17x^3 - 11x^2 + 23x + 45).\n\nThe answer is 2."

We write 2n - 1 over n times n + 1 times n + 2 as A over n plus B over n + 1 plus C over n + 2. \n\nThis leads to the equation 2n - 1 = A times n + 1 times n + 2 plus B times n times n + 2 plus C times n times n + 1. \n\nWe can then solve for the values of A, B, and C by substituting different values of n into the equation. Setting n = 0, we get -1 = 2A, so A is -1/2. \n\nSetting n = -1, we get -3 = -B, so B is 3. \n\nSetting n = -2, we get 2C = -5, so C is -5/2. \n\nTherefore, the fraction 2n - 1 over n times n + 1 times n + 2 can be expressed as -1/2 over n plus 3 over n + 1 minus 5/2 over n + 2. \n\nNow, let's consider the sum of the series.

Hence, x to the power of 4 plus 12x to the power of 3 plus 36x squared minus 128x equals 0. We can take out a factor of x, to get x times x to the power of 3 plus 12x squared plus 36x minus 128 equals 0. We can check that x equals 2 is a root of the cubic, so we can also take out a factor of x minus 2, to get x times x minus 2 times x squared plus 14x plus 64 equals 0. The quadratic factor has no real roots, so the real solutions are x equals 0 and x equals 2. For x equals 0, y equals 0, and for x equals 2, y squared equals 16, so y equals plus or minus 4.

        "answer": "From the given equation, we can start by rewriting it as follows: the cube root of 15x minus 1, plus the cube root of 13x plus 1, minus 4 times the cube root of x equals 0. We can also write this as the cube root of 15x minus 1, plus the cube root of 13x plus 1, plus the cube root of minus 64x equals 0.\n\nLet's denote the cube root of 15x minus 1 as a, the cube root of 13x plus 1 as b, and the cube root of minus 64x as c, so a plus b plus c equals 0. From the factorization of a^3 plus b^3 plus c^3 minus 3 times a times b times c equals the product of a plus b plus c, and a^2 plus b^2 plus c^2 minus a times b minus a times c minus b times c, we have that a^3 plus b^3 plus c^3 equals 3 times a times b times c.\n\nHence, minus 36x equals 3 times the cube root of the product of 15x minus 1, 13x plus 1, and minus 64x. We can simplify this to 3 times x equals the cube root of the product of 15x minus 1, 13x plus 1, and x. Cubing both sides, we get 27 times x^3 equals 195 times x^3 plus 2 times x^2 minus x, so 168 times x^3 plus 2 times x^2 minus x equals 0.\n\nThis factors as x times 14x minus 1 times 12x plus 1 equals 0, so the solutions are 0, 1 over 14, and minus 1 over 12."

Additionally, this circle is tangent to another circle that is centered at (3, 0) with a radius of 1. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the value of r: (r - 3)^2 + r^2 = (r + 1)^2. Upon simplifying this equation, we obtain r^2 - 8r + 8 = 0. We can then use the quadratic formula to find the roots of this equation, which will give us the possible values of r. The roots are r = 4 + 2*sqrt(2) and r = 4 - 2*sqrt(2). Hence, the sum of all possible values of r is 4 + 2*sqrt(2) + 4 - 2*sqrt(2), which simplifies to 8. \n\nThe answer is 8."

Since f of f inverse of x equals x, this equation is equivalent to x equals 2 times f inverse of x plus 1, which simplifies to f inverse of x equals x minus 1, all divided by 2. \n\nIf we assume x solves the equation f inverse of x equals f of 1 over x, then we get the equation x minus 1, all divided by 2, equals 2 over x plus 1, which is equal to 2 plus x, all divided by x. Cross multiplying gives us x squared minus x equals 4 plus 2x. Then we have x squared minus 3x minus 4 equals 0. \n\nFactoring gives us x minus 4, times x plus 1, equals 0, from which we find x equals 4 or x equals minus 1. The sum of the solutions is 4 plus minus 1, which equals 3. \n\nAlternatively, since Vieta's formula tells us that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation ax squared plus bx plus c is minus b over a, the sum of the roots of x squared minus 3x minus 4 is minus minus 3 over 1, which equals 3. \n\nThe answer is 3."

This holds true for the point T as well, so we can write the equation 2 * sqrt(((d - 3)/2)^2 + 7^2) = d + 3.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get sqrt((d - 3)^2 + 196) = d + 3.

First, the inequality 3 is less than or equal to x divided by 2x minus 5 is equivalent to 0 is less than or equal to x divided by 2x minus 5 minus 3. This can be simplified to 0 is less than or equal to x minus 3 times 2x minus 5 divided by 2x minus 5, which further simplifies to 0 is less than or equal to minus 5x plus 15 divided by 2x minus 5.\n\nMaking a sign table, we have the following results:\n- When x is less than 5/2, minus 5x plus 15 is positive and 2x minus 5 is negative, resulting in a negative value for the entire expression.\n- When x is between 5/2 and 3, minus 5x plus 15 is positive and 2x minus 5 is positive, resulting in a positive value for the entire expression.\n- When x is greater than 3, minus 5x plus 15 is negative and 2x minus 5 is positive, resulting in a negative value for the entire expression.\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds when x is between 5/2 and 3, as well as the endpoint x equals 3, which makes the right-hand side zero. The solution set to the first inequality is the interval from 5/2 to 3, including 3.\n\nSecond, the inequality x divided by 2x minus 5 is less than 8 is equivalent to x divided by 2x minus 5 minus 8 is less than 0. This can be simplified to x minus 8 times 2x minus 5 divided by 2x minus 5 is less than 0, which further simplifies to minus 15x plus 40 divided by 2x minus 5 is less than 0.\n\nMaking another sign table, we have the following results:\n- When x is less than 5/2, minus 15x plus 40 is positive and 2x minus 5 is negative, resulting in a negative value for the entire expression.\n- When x is between 5/2 and 8/3, minus 15x plus 40 is positive and 2x minus 5 is positive, resulting in a positive value for the entire expression.\n- When x is greater than 8/3, minus 15x plus 40 is negative and 2x minus 5 is positive, resulting in a negative value for the entire expression.\n\nIt follows that the inequality holds when either x is less than 5/2 or x is greater than 8/3.\n\nThe intersection of this solution set with the interval from 5/2 to 3, including 3, is the interval from 8/3 to 3, including 3, which is the solution set for both inequalities combined.\n\nThe answer is (8/3, 3]."

        "answer": "Consider the term 1 divided by x sub k minus 1 plus 1. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by x sub k minus 1 to get x sub k minus 1 divided by x sub k minus 1 squared plus x sub k minus 1, which equals x sub k minus 1 divided by x sub k. \n\nTo get the sum to telescope, we can multiply the numerator and denominator again by x sub k minus 1: x sub k minus 1 squared divided by x sub k minus 1 times x sub k, which equals x sub k minus x sub k minus 1 divided by x sub k minus 1 times x sub k, which equals 1 divided by x sub k minus 1 minus 1 divided by x sub k. \n\nHence, 1 divided by x sub 1 plus 1 plus 1 divided by x sub 2 plus 1 plus 1 divided by x sub 3 plus 1 and so on, equals 1 divided by x sub 1 minus 1 divided by x sub 2 plus 1 divided by x sub 2 minus 1 divided by x sub 3 plus 1 divided by x sub 3 minus 1 divided by x sub 4 and so on. \n\nThis simplifies to 1 divided by x sub 1, which equals 1 divided by 115. \n\nThe answer is 1/115."

But xz + (xy + y^2 + yz) is equal to (x + y) times (y + z), so we have (x + y) times (y + z) is greater than or equal to 2 times the square root of xyz times (x + y + z). \n\nThen, by squaring both sides of the inequality, we get (x + y) squared times (y + z) squared is greater than or equal to 4 times xyz times (x + y + z). Therefore, xyz times (x + y + z) divided by (x + y) squared times (y + z) squared is less than or equal to 1/4. \n\nEquality occurs when xz is equal to xy + y^2 + yz. For example, we can take x = 2, y = 1, and z = 3. Thus, the maximum value is 1/4."

        "answer": "Setting x equal to 0 in the second equation gives us f(-1) = f(0)^2 - 2. Setting x equal to -1 in the second equation gives us f(0) = (f(-1) + 1)^2 - 1. Let's denote f(0) as a and f(-1) as b. Then we have b = a^2 - 2 and a = (b + 1)^2 - 1. Substituting b = a^2 - 2 into the equation gives us a = (a^2 - 1)^2 - 1. This simplifies to a^4 - 2a^2 - a = 0, which can be factored as a(a + 1)(a^2 - a - 1) = 0. The quadratic equation a^2 - a - 1 = 0 does not have any integer solutions, so a must be either 0 or -1.\n\nLet's assume f(0) = a = 0. Then f(-1) = -2. Setting x = -1 in the first equation gives us f(3) - f(-1) = 12, so f(3) = f(-1) + 12 = 10. However, setting x = 2 in the second equation gives us f(3) = (f(2) - 2)^2 + 2, which means (f(2) - 2)^2 = 8. There is no integer value of f(2) that satisfies this equation.\n\nTherefore, f(0) = a = -1. Setting x = 1 in the second equation gives us f(0) = (f(1) - 1)^2 - 1, so (f(1) - 1)^2 = 0, which means f(1) = 1.\n\nThus, the values of f(0) and f(1) are (-1, 1).

This means that either b + 10 and c + 10 are both equal to 1, or they are both equal to -1.\n\nIf b + 10 and c + 10 are both equal to 1, then b and c are both equal to -9. Substituting these values into the original equation, we get (x - a)(x - 10) + 1 = (x - 9)^2. Simplifying this equation, we find that (x - 9)^2 - 1 = (x - 10)(x - 8), which means that a is equal to 8.\n\nOn the other hand, if b + 10 and c + 10 are both equal to -1, then b and c are both equal to 11. Substituting these values into the original equation, we get (x - a)(x - 10) + 1 = (x - 11)^2.

        "answer": "By the definition of the sequence, we can express each term as the difference between two consecutive partial sums. This gives us an equation that relates each term to the partial sums. Solving this equation, we find that the partial sums follow a specific pattern. \n\nWe start with the definition of the sequence: a_n = S_n - S_(n-1), where S_n is the nth partial sum. Substituting this into the given equation, we get S_n - S_(n-1) = (2*S_n^2) / (2*S_n - 1). Rearranging this equation, we find that (2*S_n - 1)*(S_n - S_(n-1)) = 2*S_n^2.\n\nSimplifying this, we get S_(n-1) = 2*S_(n-1)*S_n + S_n. If S_n is zero, then S_(n-1) must also be zero. However, since S_1 is 1, we know that all the partial sums are nonzero. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by S_(n-1)*S_n, which gives us 1/S_n = 1/S_(n-1) + 2.\n\nUsing this recursive relationship, we can find the values of 1/S_n for the first few terms. Since 1/S_1 is 1, we find that 1/S_2 is 3, 1/S_3 is 5, and so on. In general, we can see that 1/S_n = 2*n - 1, which means that S_n = 1 / (2*n - 1).\n\nFinally, we can use this formula to find the value of a_100. We have a_100 = S_100 - S_99 = 1/199 - 1/197. Simplifying this, we get a_100 = -2/39203."

The imaginary part must be 0, so 3 times i times k to the power of 3 minus 27 times i times k equals 3 times i times k times (k to the power of 2 minus 9) equals 0. Since k equals 0 does not work, we must have k equals plus or minus 3. Therefore, the pure imaginary solutions are 3i and -3i."

Thus, x^4 - 4x - 1 can be expressed as (x^2 + p)^2 - 2px^2 - p^2 - 4x - 1, which further simplifies to (x^2 + p)^2 - (2px^2 + 4x + p^2 + 1). \n\nIf we can choose a value of p such that 2px^2 + 4x + p^2 + 1 is the square of a binomial, then we can factor the quartic using the difference-of-squares factorization. The quadratic 2px^2 + 4x + p^2 + 1 is a perfect square if and only if its discriminant is 0, so 4^2 - 4(2p)(p^2 + 1) = 0. This simplifies to p^3 + p - 2 = 0. We see that p = 1 is a root.\n\nThen for p = 1, we get x^4 - 4x - 1 = (x^2 + 1)^2 - (2x^2 + 4x + 2), which further simplifies to (x^2 + 1)^2 - 2(x^2 + 2x + 1), and then to (x^2 + 1)^2 - [(x + 1) sqrt(2)]^2. Using the difference of squares formula, this becomes (x^2 + (x + 1) sqrt(2) + 1)(x^2 - (x + 1) sqrt(2) + 1), which can also be written as (x^2 + x sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) + 1)(x^2 - x sqrt(2) - sqrt(2) + 1).\n\nThe discriminant of the first quadratic factor is negative, so it has no real roots. The discriminant of the second quadratic factor is positive, so a and b are the roots of this quadratic. Then by Vieta's formulas, a + b = sqrt(2) and ab = -sqrt(2) + 1, so ab + a + b = 1."

Either way, xy = -3.\n\nAlternatively, the second equation can be factored as (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) = 28. Since x - y = 4, we have x^2 + xy + y^2 = 28/4 = 7.

We know that m + n = 95, which means the total number of terms is 95. \n\nWe are also given that the sum of the squares of these numbers is 95. Since each term is either 1 or -1, its square will be 1. So, the sum of the squares being 95 implies that we indeed have 95 terms.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum S of all the distinct pairs of terms in the sequence, where each pair is multiplied together. We want to find the minimum possible value of S that is still positive.\n\nTo approach this, we look at the sum of all the terms in the sequence. Since each term is either 1 or -1, the sum will be m - n, where m is the number of 1's and n is the number of -1's. We already know that m + n = 95, so m - n can be expressed as 95 - 2n.\n\nThe sum of all the terms squared, which is (m - n)^2, is an odd perfect square because m - n is odd. To minimize S while keeping it positive, we look for the smallest odd perfect square greater than 95, which is 121.\n\nUsing the given equation 2S + 95 = (m - n)^2, we can solve for S. Plugging in the value of (m - n)^2 as 121, we get 2S + 95 = 121. Solving for S, we find S = (121 - 95) / 2 = 13.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible positive value of S is 13, which occurs when there are 53 ones and 42 negative ones in the sequence. So, the smallest possible positive value of S is 13. The answer is 13."

        "question": "A famous theorem states that given any five points in the plane, with no three on the same line, there is a unique conic section, which can be an ellipse, hyperbola, or parabola, that passes through all five points. The conic section passing through the five points, negative one and a half comma one, zero comma zero, zero comma two, three comma zero, and three comma two, is an ellipse whose axes are parallel to the coordinate axes. Find the length of its minor axis.",
        "answer": "The four points (0,0), (0,2), (3,0), and (3,2) form a rectangle, and the horizontal line through (-3/2, 1) bisects the rectangle. So, visually, we hope that the center of the ellipse coincides with the center of the rectangle, which has coordinates (3/2, 1), and that its major axis should pass through the point (-3/2, 1).\n\nIn this case, the semimajor axis has length 3/2 - (-3/2) = 3. Then, its equation must take the form ((x-3/2)^2)/3^2 + ((y-1)^2)/b^2 = 1, where b is the length of the semiminor axis. Since (0,0) lies on the ellipse, setting x=y=0, we have ((3/2)^2)/3^2 + 1/b^2 = 1, or 1/4 + 1/b^2 = 1. Solving for b gives b = (2*sqrt(3))/3, so the length of the minor axis is 2b = 4*sqrt(3)/3.\n\nThe answer is 4*sqrt(3)/3."

        "answer": "The sum of the distances from the point (0,0) to the two foci is 2 + 3 = 5. By the definition of an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci must also be 5. So, in particular, if (x, 0) is the other x-intercept, the distance formula gives the equation: distance from x to 3 plus distance from x to 0 and 2, equals 5. \n\nAfter drawing the ellipse, it is clear that x is greater than 3, so we can drop the absolute values around x - 3. Then, solving for x gives: the square root of x squared plus 4 equals 5 minus x. \n\nBy squaring both sides of this equation, we get x squared plus 4 equals x squared minus 16x plus 64. Simplifying this gives 16x equals 60, so x equals 60 divided by 16, which equals 15 divided by 4. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (15/4, 0)."

        "answer": "Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step. \n\nWe are given a polynomial P(z) with real coefficients, and we need to find the value of a + b + c, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nFirst, we are given that w = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. We are also given that the sum of the three roots of the polynomial is (w + 3i) + (w + 9i) + (2w - 4) = 4w - 4 + 12i = 4x + 4yi - 4 + 12i.\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is equal to -a, where a is the coefficient of the z^2 term. Since the coefficients of P(z) are all real, the sum of the roots must be a real number. This means that the imaginary part of the sum of the roots must be zero.\n\nSetting the imaginary part of the sum of the roots equal to zero, we get 4y + 12 = 0, which simplifies to y = -3.\n\nNow we know that w = x - 3i, and we can substitute this value into the expressions for the three roots: w + 3i = x, w + 9i = x + 6i, and 2w - 4 = 2x - 4 - 6i.\n\nSince the coefficients of P(z) are all real, the non-real roots must come in conjugate pairs. This means that x + 6i must be the conjugate of 2x - 4 - 6i, which implies that x = 2x - 4. Solving for x, we get x = 4.\n\nNow we know that the three roots of the polynomial are 4, 4 + 6i, and 4 - 6i. We can write the polynomial P(z) as (z - 4)(z - 4 - 6i)(z - 4 + 6i).\n\nTo find the value of a + b + c, we need to evaluate P(1). We have P(1) = (1 - 4)(1 - 4 - 6i)(1 - 4 + 6i) = -135.\n\nSince P(1) = 1 + a + b + c, we have a + b + c = -136.\n\nThe answer is -136."

Given the graph has a horizontal asymptote at y = 0, a hole at x = 0, and a vertical asymptote at x = 1, determine the functions p(x) and q(x) to find their sum.",
        "answer": "Since q(x) is quadratic and we have a horizontal asymptote at y = 0, we know that p(x) must be linear. \n\nWe have a hole at x = 0, so there must be a factor of x in both p(x) and q(x). We also have a vertical asymptote at x = 1, so the denominator q(x) must have a factor of x - 1. \n\nThen, p(x) = ax and q(x) = bx(x - 1) for some constants a and b. Since p(3) = 3, we get 3a = 3, so a = 1. Since q(2) = 2, we get 2b(2 - 1) = 2, so b = 1.\n\nSo p(x) = x and q(x) = x(x - 1) = x^2 - x. Therefore, p(x) + q(x) = x^2."

Since (x-3)(x+a) equals x squared plus (a-3)x minus 3a, we set a-3 equals 2 to find a equals 5. Expanding (x-3)(x+5), we find c equals 20. So x squared plus 2x plus 5 divided by x-3 equals x plus 5 plus 20 divided by x-3. Since x plus 5 is always an integer, x squared plus 2x plus 5 divided by x-3 is an integer if and only if 20 divided by x-3 is an integer.

Using this equation, we can rewrite the expression for t as negative of negative three minus c, times negative three minus a, times negative three minus b. \n\nTo compute this expression quickly, notice that for any x, the cubic polynomial x cubed plus three x squared plus four x minus eleven can be factored as the product of x minus a, x minus b, and x minus c, by the factor theorem.

        "answer": "We first notice that we can simplify the fraction. The given fraction can be simplified as follows: (x^3 + 2x^2) / (x^2 + 3x + 2) = x^2(x + 2) / (x + 1)(x + 2) = x^2 / (x + 1), provided that x is not equal to -2.\n\nTherefore, we have x^2 / (x + 1) + x = -6. Multiplying both sides by (x + 1) gives x^2 + x(x + 1) = -6(x + 1), or 2x^2 + 7x + 6 = 0.\n\nThis equation factors as (2x + 3)(x + 2) = 0, so x = -3/2 or x = -2.

Note that c is greater than 0 since a and b are both greater than 1. Thus, the equation becomes 2 minus c minus 1/c, which equals (c^2 minus 2c plus 1) divided by negative c, or (c-1)^2 divided by negative c, which is less than or equal to 0.\n\nThis expression equals 0 when c equals 1, that is, when a equals b.

Hence, q(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 2^2) ... (x - 2^6) / 2^21 = (x - 1)(x/2 - 1)(x/2^2 - 1) ...

Also, the constant coefficient in q(x) is -1, so q(x) is of the form q(x) = (1/2^21)x^7 + ... + (127/64)x - 1. Then p(x) = (q(x) + 1) / x = (1/2^21)x^6 + ... + 127/64.

We are given that the absolute value of a is 1, which implies that a times its conjugate is equal to the square of its absolute value. Hence, the conjugate of a is the reciprocal of a. Similarly, the conjugates of b and c are the reciprocals of b and c, respectively.\n\nWe then let z be the sum of a, b, and c. By expanding the square of the absolute value of z and using the fact that the conjugate of a sum is the sum of the conjugates, we simplify the expression for the square of the absolute value of z.\n\nUsing the equation for z cubed, we relate the cube of the absolute value of z to the expression obtained for the square of the absolute value of z. We then equate the two expressions for the cube of the absolute value of z and the adjusted square of the absolute value of z, and find the possible values of the absolute value of z.\n\nThese possible values are obtained by solving the equations derived from setting the adjusted square of the absolute value of z equal to its cube. The possible solutions for the absolute value of z are 1 and 2. To verify these solutions, corresponding complex numbers a, b, and c are provided for each value of the absolute value of z. \n\nThe solutions are verified for both possible values of the absolute value of z, demonstrating that both 1 and 2 are indeed achievable values for the absolute value of the sum of a, b, and c. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of |a + b + c| are 1 and 2."

        "answer": "We know that the inverse function f inverse of u equals v is the same as u equals f of v. Therefore, f inverse of g of x equals x cubed minus one is the same as g of x equals f of x cubed minus one. We can also use that g of s equals t is equivalent to s equals g inverse of t to say x equals g inverse of f of x cubed minus one. This gives an expression containing g inverse circle f.\n\nTherefore, g inverse of f of 7 is the value of x such that x cubed minus one equals 7. Solving for x, we find x equals 2."

So we know that z is cis of pi over 6 or cis of negative pi over 6.\n\nSay that z = cis of pi over 6. Then z to the power of 2010 = cis of pi over 6 to the power of 2010 = cis of 2010 pi over 6 = cis of 335 pi = cis of pi = -1. Then z inverse = -1 inverse = -1. So z to the power of 2010 + z to the power of -2010 = -1 + -1 = -2.\n\nSimilarly, if z = cis of negative pi over 6. Then z to the power of 2010 = cis of negative pi over 6 to the power of 2010 = cis of -2010 pi over 6 = cis of -335 pi = cis of -pi = -1. Then z inverse = -1 inverse = -1. So z to the power of 2010 + z to the power of -2010 = -1 + -1 = -2.\n\nThe answer is -2."

        "answer": "The area of the triangle, denoted as K, and the semi-perimeter, denoted as p, are related by Heron's formula as follows: \nK squared equals p times the quantity p minus r times p minus s times p minus t. \nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum of r, s, and t is 4, which implies that p equals 2. \nSince r, s, and t are the roots of the cubic equation x cubed minus 4x squared plus 5x minus nineteen-tenths, \nwe can express the equation as x cubed minus 4x squared plus 5x minus nineteen-tenths equals the quantity x minus r times x minus s times x minus t. \nWhen we set x equal to 2, we get the equation 2 minus r times 2 minus s times 2 minus t equals one-tenth. \nSubstituting this result into Heron's formula, we find that K squared equals 2 times the quantity 2 minus r times 2 minus s times 2 minus t, which equals one-fifth. \nTherefore, the area K equals the square root of one-fifth, which simplifies to the square root of 5 divided by 5. \nSo, the answer is the square root of 5 divided by 5."

        "answer": "Note that for a fixed value of p, F(p,q) is linear in q, which means that F(p,q) attains its maximum value either at q = 0 or q = 1. We compute that F(p,0) = 7p - 4 and F(p,1) = 3 - 5p. Hence, G(p) = the maximum of 7p - 4 and 3 - 5p. \n\nNote that 7p - 4 = 3 - 5p when p = 7/12. Then G(p) = 3 - 5p for p < 7/12, so G(p) is decreasing on this interval. Also, G(p) = 7p - 4 for p > 7/12, so G(p) is increasing on this interval.

        "answer": "Let r and s be the integer roots. Then by Vieta's formulas, r plus s equals negative a and rs equals 6a. Thus, rs plus 6 times the quantity r plus s equals 0. Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we have rs plus 6 times the quantity r plus s, plus 36 equals 36, which implies that the quantity r plus 6, times the quantity s plus 6, equals 36. The number 36 equals 2 squared, times 3 squared, has 2 times, the quantity 2 plus 1, times, the quantity 2 plus 1, equals 18 factors, both positive and negative, they come in 8 pairs, with singletons 6 and negative 6.

        "answer": "The problem statement gives us an inequality for the sum S, which is defined as the sum of pairs of distinct numbers a_i and b_i, from i = 1 to k. We are given that all the numbers a_i and b_i are distinct.\n\nWe start by finding a lower bound for the sum S. Since the numbers a_i and b_i are distinct, the smallest possible value for S is when the a_i and b_i are consecutive integers starting from 1. This means that the sum S will be greater than or equal to the sum of the first 2k positive integers.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we find that the sum of the first 2k positive integers is given by k times 2k plus 1.\n\nNext, we find an upper bound for the sum S. We are given that the k sums a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, and so on, up to a_k + b_k are all distinct and less than or equal to 2009. This means that the largest possible value for each sum a_i + b_i will be the consecutive integers from 2010 - k down to 2009.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series again, we find that the sum of these k consecutive integers is given by k times 4019 minus k, all divided by 2.\n\nBy combining the lower and upper bounds for S, we get an inequality involving k. Simplifying this inequality gives us 2k plus 1 is less than or equal to 4019 minus k, all divided by 2.\n\nSolving for k, we find that k is less than or equal to 4017 divided by 5, which means that k is less than or equal to 803.\n\nTo show that k can indeed be 803, we can exhibit 803 pairs of distinct numbers that satisfy the conditions of the problem. These pairs are 1 and 1207, 2 and 1208, and so on, up to 401 and 1607, then 402 and 805, 403 and 806, and so on, up to 803 and 1206.\n\nThus, the maximum possible value of k is 803."

        "answer": "The given equation is true, and multiplying by (x+C)(x+7) gives the equation (x+B)(Ax+28) = 2(x+C)(x+7), which must also be true. This equation must have infinitely many roots for x, meaning the polynomials (x+B)(Ax+28) and 2(x+C)(x+7) must agree for infinitely many values of x, so they must be identical polynomials.\n\nExpanding both sides gives Ax^2 + (AB+28)x + 28B = 2x^2 + (2C+14)x + 14C. Corresponding coefficients of both sides must be equal, so A = 2, AB+28 = 2C+14, and 28B = 14C.\n\nFrom the first and third equations, A = 2 and C = 2B. Substituting into the second equation gives 2B + 28 = 4B + 14, so B = 7, and then C = 14. The original equation was (x+7)(2x+28) / (x+14)(x+7) = 2.\n\nThis equation holds whenever the denominator is nonzero.

Therefore, the pair (a, b) satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points, which are points with integer coordinates.\n\nTo find the lattice points on the circle, we need to find the integer solutions to the equation x squared + y squared = 50. By testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: (1, 7), (1, -7), (-1, 7), (-1, -7), (7, 1), (7, -1), (-7, 1), (-7, -1), (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), and (-5, -5).\n\nThere are sixty-six pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the line cannot pass through the origin (0, 0), since if x = 0 and y = 0, then ax + by = 0, which is not equal to 1. Therefore, the six pairs that consist of diametrically opposed points are not valid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This brings the total number of valid pairs to sixty.\n\nIn addition to these pairs, for each of the twelve points, there is a line that is tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This means that there are twelve more lines that satisfy the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions is sixty plus twelve, which is equal to seventy-two.

From these equations, we can derive the equation x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 2009^2, which simplifies to x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 2009^2 + 4 * 2009. \n\nThen, we can determine that x + y = sqrt(2009^2 + 4 * 2009), and by using Vieta's formulas, we find that x and y are the roots of the equation t^2 - sqrt(2009^2 + 4 * 2009) * t + 2009 = 0. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is 2009^2, which confirms that it has real roots.\n\nUsing these values of x and y, we can then determine that f(2009) = sqrt(f(2009) + 2). By letting a = f(2009), we get a = sqrt(a + 2). Squaring both sides of the equation gives us a^2 = a + 2, which can be rewritten as a^2 - a - 2 = 0. \n\nThis equation factors into (a - 2)(a + 1) = 0, and since a is a positive number, we conclude that a = 2.

The inequality of this ratio being greater than 1 holds if and only if k is less than 1001 divided by 6, which equals 166.8 recurring, that is, if k is less than or equal to 166. \n\nTherefore, A sub k is greater than A sub k minus 1 when k is less than or equal to 166, and A sub k is less than A sub k minus 1 when k is greater than or equal to 167.

        "answer": "The rational root theorem states that any rational root p/q of g(x) must have p divide 4 and q divide 1. In particular, this means any rational root must be an integer divisor of 4. \n\nBy trying out the integer factors of 4, we find that g(2) equals 8 minus 9 times 4 plus 16 times 2 minus 4, which equals 0. Hence, by the factor theorem, x-2 is a factor of g(x). With polynomial division, we can write g(x) as (x-2) times (x squared minus 7x plus 2). We can find the remaining roots of g(x) by finding the roots of x squared minus 7x plus 2 using the quadratic formula. \n\nThis gives us x equals 7 plus or minus the square root of 49 minus 8, all divided by 2, which equals 7 plus or minus the square root of 41, all divided by 2. Since these are definitely not rational, the sum of the rational roots of g(x) is 2. \n\nThe final answer is 2."

        "question": "In an increasing sequence of four positive integers, the first three terms form an arithmetic progression, the last three terms form a geometric progression, and the first and fourth terms differ by 30. Find the sum of the four terms.",
        "answer": "The first three terms are denoted by a, a + d, and a + 2d, where a and d are positive integers. Then the fourth term is a + 30. Since the last three terms form an arithmetic sequence, we have the equation (a + d)(a + 30) = (a + 2d)^2. This simplifies to a^2 + (30 + d)a + 30d = a^2 + 4ad + 4d^2. Solving for a, we get a = (4d^2 - 30d) / (30 - 3d) = (2d(2d - 15)) / (3(10 - d)).\n\nSince a is positive, we must have the function f(d) = (d(2d - 15)) / (10 - d) greater than 0. We construct a sign table for this expression. The table shows that for d greater than 0, we must have 15/2 less than d less than 10, which only gives two possible integer values for d, namely 8 and 9.\n\nFor d = 8, we get a = (2 * 8 * 1) / (3 * 2) = 8/3, which is not an integer. So, we must have d = 9 and a = (2 * 9 * 3) / (3 * 1) = 18. Then the sum of the four terms is a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 30) = 18 + 27 + 36 + 48 = 129.\n\nThe answer is 129."

        "answer": "In the first equation, adding (a-13)x to both sides gives us ax + by + cz = (a-13)x. Solving for x, we have x = (ax + by + cz) / (a-13). Since a is not equal to 13 and x is not equal to 0, both sides of the equation are non-zero. \n\nSimilarly, from the second and third equations, y = (ax + by + cz) / (b-23) and z = (ax + by + cz) / (c-42). Then we know that ax + by + cz = a * (ax + by + cz) / (a-13) + b * (ax + by + cz) / (b-23) + c * (ax + by + cz) / (c-42) = (ax + by + cz) * (a / (a-13) + b / (b-23) + c / (c-42)). \n\nIf ax + by + cz = 0, then x = (ax + by + cz) / (a-13) = 0.

We know that f(7) will be the remainder when f(x) is divided by x - 7. \n\nTo find this, we perform polynomial division. The dividend is 2x^4 - 17x^3 + 26x^2 - 24x - 60 and the divisor is x - 7. \n\nWe start by dividing 2x^4 by x, which gives 2x^3. Multiplying 2x^3 by x - 7 gives 2x^4 - 14x^3. Subtracting this from the dividend gives -3x^3 + 26x^2 - 24x - 60.\n\nNext, we divide -3x^3 by x, which gives -3x^2. Multiplying -3x^2 by x - 7 gives -3x^3 + 21x^2. Subtracting this from the previous result gives 5x^2 - 24x - 60.\n\nThen, we divide 5x^2 by x, which gives 5x. Multiplying 5x by x - 7 gives 5x^2 - 35x. Subtracting this from the previous result gives 11x - 60.\n\nNext, we divide 11x by x, which gives 11. Multiplying 11 by x - 7 gives 11x - 77.

The first equation gives x^2 = y - 2, so we can substitute into the second equation to get y^2 - m(y - 2) = 1, or y^2 - my + (2m - 1) = 0.\n\nFor the parabola and hyperbola to be tangent, this equation must have exactly one solution for y, so the discriminant must be zero: m^2 - 4(2m - 1) = 0.\n\nThus, m^2 - 8m + 4 = 0, which gives m = (8 \u00b1 sqrt(8^2 - 4 * 4)) / 2 = 4 \u00b1 2 sqrt(3).\n\nTo choose between the two possible values of m, we attempt to solve for y in the equation y^2 - my + (2m - 1) = 0. For m = 4 \u00b1 2 sqrt(3), we have y = (m \u00b1 sqrt(m^2 - 4(2m - 1))) / 2 = m / 2, because these values of m make the discriminant zero.\n\nSince y = x^2 + 2, we have y \u2265 2, so we must have m / 2 \u2265 2, or m \u2265 4.

        "answer": "Without loss of generality, we can assume that the distance between the two foci, F1 and F2, is 2, so c is 1. Since triangle QF1F2 is equilateral, b is the square root of 3 and a is 2.\n\nWe are given an equilateral triangle PQR with side length s, and M is the midpoint of PR. Therefore, RM is s/2. We also know that RF1 is QR - QF1, which is s - 2, so the distance from R to the x-axis is the square root of 3 divided by 2, times s - 2.\n\nSo, point R is located at coordinates (s/2, - square root of 3 divided by 2, times s - 2). Substituting these coordinates into the equation of the ellipse, we get an equation in terms of s. After simplifying this equation, we find that 5s^2 equals 16s, so s equals 16/5.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of PQ to F1F2, which is the same as the ratio of the side length of the equilateral triangle PQR to the distance between the foci.

        "answer": "Note that 2 to the power of 4 equals 4 to the power of 2, so from the given condition, either f of 2 equals 4 or f of 4 equals 2. But from the first condition, f of 4 is greater than f of 3, which is greater than f of 2, which is greater than f of 1. So, f of 4 is greater than or equal to 4. Hence, f of 2 equals 4. By applying the second condition repeatedly, we find that f of 2 to the power of n equals 2 to the power of 2n for all positive integers n.\n\nFrom the first and third conditions, f of 3 squared equals f of 9, which is greater than f of 8, which equals 64. So, f of 3 is greater than or equal to 9. Similarly, f of 3 to the power of 8 equals f of 3 to the power of 8, which is less than f of 2 to the power of 13, which equals 2 to the power of 26. So, f of 3 is less than or equal to 9. Therefore, f of 3 equals 9. It follows that f of 3 to the power of n equals 3 to the power of 2n for all positive integers n.\n\nNow, f of 5 cubed equals f of 5 cubed, which is less than f of 2 to the power of 7, which equals 2 to the power of 14. So, f of 5 is less than or equal to 25. Also, f of 5 to the power of 11 equals f of 5 to the power of 11, which is greater than f of 3 to the power of 16, which equals 3 to the power of 32. So, f of 5 is greater than or equal to 25. Therefore, f of 5 equals 25.\n\nHence, f of 30 equals f of 2 times f of 3 times f of 5, which equals 4 times 9 times 25, which equals 900. Note that the function f of n equals n squared satisfies all the given properties. It can be shown that the only solutions to n to the power of m equals m to the power of n where m is not equal to n are 2 and 4, and 4 and 2. \n\nThe answer is 900."

        "answer": "Setting x = y = 0, we get f(0) squared equals 4f(0) squared. Then f(0) squared equals 0, so f(0) equals 0.\n\nSetting x = y, we get 4f(x) squared minus 4x squared f(x) equals 0, so f(x) times f(x) minus x squared equals 0. This tells us that for each value of x, either f(x) equals 0 or f(x) equals x squared. \n\nWe can easily check that f(x) equals x squared satisfies the given functional equation. Otherwise, there exists some nonzero real number a such that f(a) equals 0. Setting y = a, we get f(x + a) times f(x - a) equals f(x) squared for all x.\n\nSuppose there exists a real number b such that f(b) is not equal to 0. Then f(b) equals b squared. Substituting x = b into the equation above, we get f(b + a) times f(b - a) equals f(b) squared equals b to the power of 4.\n\nSince f(b) equals b squared is not equal to 0, both f(b + a) and f(b - a) must be nonzero. Therefore, f(b + a) equals b + a squared and f(b - a) equals b - a squared, and b + a squared times b - a squared equals b to the power of 4.\n\nExpanding, we get a to the power of 4 minus 2a squared b squared plus b to the power of 4 equals b to the power of 4, so a to the power of 4 minus 2a squared b squared equals 0. Then a squared times a squared minus 2b squared equals 0. Since a is nonzero, a squared equals 2b squared, which leads to b equals plus or minus a over the square root of 2.\n\nThis tells us that if there exists some nonzero real number a such that f(a) equals 0, then the only possible values of x such that f(x) is not equal to 0 are x equals plus or minus a over the square root of 2. We must have that f(x) equals 0 for all other values of x.\n\nWe can then choose a different value of a' such that f(a') equals 0, which leads to f(x) equals 0 for all x other than x equals plus or minus a' over the square root of 2. This forces f(x) equals 0 for all x, which easily satisfies the given functional equation.\n\nTherefore, there are only 2 functions that work, namely f(x) equals 0 and f(x) equals x squared."

Since the magnitude of z = 1, x squared + y squared = 1. Also, 2i * (z squared - (z conjugate squared)) = 2i * ((x + yi) squared - (x - yi) squared) = 2i * (4ixy) = -8xy, so the magnitude of w squared = 5 - 8xy.\n\nBy the Trivial Inequality, (x + y) squared is greater than or equal to 0. Then x squared + 2xy + y squared is greater than or equal to 0, so 2xy + 1 is greater than or equal to 0. Hence, -8xy is less than or equal to 4, so the magnitude of w squared = 5 - 8xy is less than or equal to 9, which implies the magnitude of w is less than or equal to 3.\n\nEquality occurs when z = -1/sqrt(2) + i/sqrt(2), so the maximum distance between S and the origin is 3."

Since x squared plus five x plus six is increasing on this interval, we have that x squared plus five x plus six is greater than two squared plus five times two plus six equals twenty, and x squared plus five x plus six is less than three squared plus five times three plus six equals thirty.

        "answer": "Since 0 is less than or equal to c, which is less than or equal to 1, the square root of c is less than or equal to 1 and the square root of 1 minus c is less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the square root of abc plus the square root of 1 minus a, 1 minus b, and 1 minus c is less than or equal to the square root of ab plus the square root of 1 minus a and 1 minus b.\n\nUsing the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, we find that the square root of ab is less than or equal to a plus b divided by 2, and the square root of 1 minus a and 1 minus b is less than or equal to 1 minus a plus 1 minus b divided by 2, which simplifies to 2 minus a minus b divided by 2.\n\nCombining these inequalities, we get that the square root of ab plus the square root of 1 minus a and 1 minus b is less than or equal to a plus b divided by 2 plus 2 minus a minus b divided by 2, which equals 1.\n\nThe maximum value occurs when a equals b equals c equals 0.

        "answer": "The given equation is first rewritten as the sum of square roots and a variable term. To simplify this, a substitution is made by letting y equal the sum of the square roots of x and x plus seven. By squaring y, an expression is obtained that can be used to eliminate the radical terms in the original equation, resulting in a quadratic equation in terms of y. \n\nThe quadratic equation is then factored, and since y must be a positive value, it is determined that y equals six. Using this value of y, the equation is then rewritten to solve for the square root of x plus seven in terms of the square root of x. \n\nBy squaring both sides of the resulting equation, the radicals are eliminated, and the value of x is calculated. The final solution for x is found to be the fraction twenty-nine over twelve squared, which equals eight hundred forty-one over one hundred forty-four. This value can be verified as a valid solution by plugging it back into the original equation. \n\nTherefore, the value of x that satisfies the equation is eight hundred forty-one over one hundred forty-four."

When we substitute x equals b into the definition of f, we get f of b equals b divided by, open parenthesis, 2 times b, minus 3, close parenthesis, so we are looking for all solutions b to the equation b divided by, open parenthesis, 2 times b, minus 3, close parenthesis, equals b plus 1.

Note that f(f(f(0))) = f(f(0)) = f(0) and f(f(0)) = f(0), so f(0) = f(0)^2 + f(0). Then f(0)^2 = 0, so f(0) = 0.

        "answer": "Since the coefficients of f(x) are real, the nonreal roots of f(x) must come in conjugate pairs. Furthermore, the magnitude of a complex number and its conjugate are always equal. If n is the number of magnitudes that correspond to nonreal roots, then f(x) has at least 2n nonreal roots, which means it has at most 2006 - 2n real roots.\n\nAlso, this leaves 1006 - n magnitudes that correspond to real roots, which means that the number of real roots is at least 1006 - n. Hence, 1006 - n is less than or equal to 2006 - 2n, so n is less than or equal to 1000. Then the number of real roots is at least 1006 - n, which is greater than or equal to 6.\n\nThe monic polynomial with roots plus or minus i, plus or minus 2i, and so on, up to plus or minus 1000i, and 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006 satisfies the conditions, and has 6 real roots, so the minimum number of real roots is 6."

We substitute y = (x + 1)^2 into x + 4 = (y - 3)^2, which gives us x + 4 = ((x + 1)^2 - 3)^2. Expanding this, we get x^4 + 4x^3 - 9x = 0. By using Vieta's formulas, we find that x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = -4.\n\nNext, we substitute x = (y - 3)^2 - 4 into y = (x + 1)^2, resulting in y = ((y - 3)^2 - 3)^2.

Find the ordered quadruple a, b, h, k.",
        "answer": "The sum of the distances from the point 14, -3 to the two foci is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates. This is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of 14-2 and -3-2, plus the square root of the sum of the squares of 14-2 and -3-6. This gives us 13 + 15 = 28. \n\nTherefore, the major axis has a length of 28. Since the distance between the foci is the square root of the sum of the squares of 2-2 and 2-6, which is equal to 4, it follows that the length of the minor axis is the square root of 28 squared minus 4 squared. This is equal to the square root of 48, which can be simplified to 4 times the square root of 3 squared times 4, or 16 times the square root of 3.\n\nThe center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the line segment between the two foci, which is 2, 4. Since the foci and the center have the same x-coordinate, the major axis is parallel to the y-axis, and the minor axis is parallel to the x-axis. Putting all of this together, we get the equation of the ellipse as the sum of the squares of x minus 2, all divided by the square of 8 times the square root of 3, plus the sum of the squares of y minus 4, all divided by 14 squared, which equals 1.\n\nThus, the final values are 8 times the square root of 3, 14, 2, and 4."

As x increases from 0 to 1, each of the four floor functions jumps up by 1 at certain points. If multiple functions jump up at the same value of x, some integers will be skipped.\n\nFor each k, the function jumps up at x = 1/k, 2/k, ..., (k-1)/k, k/k. At x = 1/2 and x = 1, all four functions jump up, skipping three integers. At x = 1/4 and x = 3/4, the functions jump up, skipping one integer.\n\nThus, for 0 < x <= 1, the function takes 20 - 3 - 3 - 1 - 1 = 12 positive integer values.

        "answer": "For the sum b_n, let j = n - k, so k = n - j. Then b_n equals the sum from k equals 0 to n of k divided by the binomial coefficient n choose k. This can be rewritten as the sum from j equals n to 0 of n - j divided by the binomial coefficient n choose n - j. By changing the order of the sum, this becomes the sum from j equals 0 to n of n - j divided by the binomial coefficient n choose j. Since j is a dummy variable, we can replace it with k to get the sum from k equals 0 to n of n - k divided by the binomial coefficient n choose k. \n\nSo, b_n plus b_n equals the sum from k equals 0 to n of k divided by the binomial coefficient n choose k, plus the sum from k equals 0 to n of n - k divided by the binomial coefficient n choose k.

We know that this is zero at x = 1, so x - 1 is a factor: 2 - f(x) = (x - 1)(x^2 + x - 2) = (x - 1)(x + 2)(x - 1). Since 0 is less than or equal to x and x is less than or equal to the square root of 3, x + 2 is always positive.

The parabola x = -1/6 y^2 is symmetric about the x-axis, so the focus is at a point of the form (f,0). Let x = d be the equation of the directrix.\n\nFor a point (-1/6 y^2, y) on the parabola, the distance from this point to the focus F is given by the equation PF^2 = (-1/6 y^2 - f)^2 + y^2, and the distance from this point to the directrix is given by PQ^2 = (-1/6 y^2 - d)^2.\n\nSince these distances are equal, we have the equation (-1/6 y^2 - f)^2 + y^2 = (-1/6 y^2 - d)^2. Expanding this equation, we get 1/36 y^4 + f/3 y^2 + f^2 + y^2 = 1/36 y^4 + d/3 y^2 + d^2.\n\nBy matching coefficients, we get two equations: f/3 + 1 = d/3 and f^2 = d^2. From the first equation, we have d - f = 3. Since f^2 = d^2, we have f = d or f = -d. However, we cannot have f = d, so f = -d.\n\nThen, 2d = 3, so d = 3/2.

To find this sum, we calculate the distance from four comma negative two to the foci, which are located at negative one comma negative one and negative one comma negative three. \n\nThe distance from four comma negative two to negative one comma negative one is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the x and y coordinates, which is the square root of open parenthesis four plus one close parenthesis squared plus open parenthesis negative one plus two close parenthesis squared, and this equals the square root of twenty six. \n\nSimilarly, the distance from four comma negative two to negative one comma negative three is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the x and y coordinates, which is the square root of open parenthesis four plus one close parenthesis squared plus open parenthesis negative three plus two close parenthesis squared, and this also equals the square root of twenty six. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the distances from four comma negative two to the foci is two times the square root of twenty six, which is equal to the length of the major axis of the ellipse. Since the distance between the foci is two, it follows that the length of the minor axis of the ellipse is the square root of the difference between the square of the length of the major axis and the square of the distance between the foci, which equals the square root of the difference between the square of two times the square root of twenty six and two squared, and this equals ten.\n\nThe center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment containing the points negative one comma negative one and negative one comma negative three, which is negative one comma negative two. Since the two foci have the same x coordinate, the vertical axis is the major axis. Putting all this together, we get that the equation of the ellipse is the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates and the center of the ellipse, divided by the squares of the lengths of the semi major and semi minor axes, which equals one.\n\nThus, a plus k equals five plus negative two, which equals three."

        "answer": "Since z^7 = -1, the absolute value of z^7 is 1. Then the absolute value of z raised to the power of 7 is 1, so the absolute value of z is 1. This means that z multiplied by its conjugate is equal to the square of the absolute value of z, which is 1. Therefore, the conjugate of z is equal to 1/z.\n\nWe can then express 1 divided by the square of the absolute value of 1-z as 1 divided by the product of 1-z and its conjugate. This is equal to 1 divided by the product of 1-z and 1 minus the conjugate of z. Since the conjugate of z is 1/z, this becomes 1 divided by the product of 1-z and 1-1/z.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get z divided by the product of 1-z and z-1. This can be rewritten as -z divided by the square of z-1.\n\nNow, let's substitute z = 1/w + 1 into this expression. We get -z divided by the square of z-1 = - (1/w + 1) divided by (1/w)^2 = -w - w^2.\n\nFrom the equation z^7 = -1, we can substitute z = 1/w + 1 to get (1/w + 1)^7 = -1. Multiplying both sides by w^7, we get (1 + w)^7 = -w^7.\n\nExpanding the left-hand side of this equation, we get 2w^7 + 7w^6 + 21w^5 + 35w^4 + 35w^3 + 21w^2 + 7w + 1 = 0.\n\nLet's denote the roots of the equation z^7 = -1 as z1, z2, ..., z7, and the corresponding values of w as w1, w2, ..., w7, where zk = 1/wk + 1.\n\nThen, the sum of 1 divided by the square of the absolute value of 1-zk is equal to the sum of -wk - wk^2.\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, we can find the sum of wk and the sum of the products of pairs of wk. The sum of wk is -7/2, and the sum of the products of pairs of wk is 21/2.\n\nSquaring the equation for the sum of wk, we get the sum of the squares of wk plus twice the sum of the products of pairs of wk. This is equal to 49/4.\n\nSubtracting twice the sum of the products of pairs of wk from both sides, we get the sum of the squares of wk = 49/4 - 2 * 21/2 = -35/4.\n\nFinally, the sum of -wk - wk^2 is equal to the sum of wk plus the sum of the squares of wk.

By definition, the distance from P to the focus F is equal to the distance from P to the directrix. The distance from P to F can be calculated using the distance formula, which gives us the square root of (x^2 + (y - 1)^2). The distance from P to the directrix is y + 1.\n\nSetting these two distances equal to each other, we get the equation: square root of (x^2 + (y - 1)^2) = y + 1. Squaring both sides of the equation, we get x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = (y + 1)^2. Simplifying this equation, we find that x^2 = 4y.\n\nWe are given that the distance from P to F, denoted as PF, is equal to 101. Since PF = y + 1, we can solve for y: y + 1 = 101, which gives us y = 100. Substituting this value of y into the equation x^2 = 4y, we get x^2 = 400.

The product of two of these roots is 13 plus i and the sum of the other two roots is 3 plus 4i, where i squared equals negative 1. Find b.",
        "answer": "Since the coefficients of the polynomial are all real, the four non-real roots must come in two conjugate pairs. Let z and w be the two roots that multiply to 13 + i. Since 13 + i is not real, z and w cannot be conjugates of each other, as any complex number times its conjugate is a real number. Therefore, the other two roots must be the conjugates of z and w, denoted as conjugate z and conjugate w. Therefore, we have that the product of z and w equals 13 + i, and the sum of conjugate z and conjugate w equals 3 + 4i.\n\nTo find b, we use Vieta's formulas, which state that b equals the second symmetric sum of the roots. This sum can be expressed as the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time. So, b equals the sum of zw, z times conjugate z, z times conjugate w, w times conjugate z, w times conjugate w, and conjugate z times conjugate w.\n\nWe can evaluate this expression by first recognizing the terms zw and conjugate z times conjugate w. We have zw equals 13 + i, so conjugate z times conjugate w equals the conjugate of zw, which equals 13 - i. Thus, b equals 26 plus the sum of z times conjugate z, z times conjugate w, w times conjugate z, and w times conjugate w.\n\nTo finish, we can factor the remaining terms by grouping. So, b equals 26 plus the product of the sum of z and w, and the sum of conjugate z and conjugate w. From the equation conjugate z plus conjugate w equals 3 + 4i, we get z + w equals 3 - 4i. Thus, b equals 26 plus the product of 3 - 4i and 3 + 4i, which equals 26 plus 9 + 12i - 12i - 16i squared. Since i squared equals -1, we get b equals 26 plus 9 plus 16, which equals 51. \n\nThe answer is 51."

        "answer": "Since the parabola passes through the points (0,0) and (2T,0), the equation is of the form y = ax(x - 2T). For the vertex, x = T, and y = aT(-T) = -aT^2. The sum of the coordinates of the vertex is then N = T - aT^2.\n\nSetting x = 2T + 1, we get a(2T + 1) = 28. The possible values of 2T + 1 are 7, -1, and -7. (We do not include 1, because T is not equal to 0.)

Substituting into the first equation, we get x + 24/x = 10, which rearranges to the quadratic x^2 - 10x + 24 = 0. This quadratic factors as (x-4)(x-6) = 0, so the possible values for x are 4 and 6.

        "answer": "We can write the given expression as the ratio of xy to the sum of the squares of x and y, which can be further simplified to the reciprocal of the sum of the ratios of x to y and y to x. To maximize this denominator, we let t be the ratio of x to y, so the sum of the ratios becomes t plus the reciprocal of t.\n\nWe want to find the maximum value of this expression. To do this, we define a function f of t as t plus the reciprocal of t. We then consider two cases: when t is less than u, and when u is less than or equal to 1.\n\nIn the first case, where 0 is less than t, which is less than u, we find that f of u minus f of t is greater than 0, which means that f of u is greater than f of t. This implies that the function f is increasing on the interval from 1 to infinity.\n\nIn the second case, where 0 is less than or equal to t, which is less than u, and u is less than or equal to 1, we find that f of u minus f of t is less than 0, which means that f of u is less than f of t. This implies that the function f is decreasing on the interval from 0 to 1.\n\nTo maximize the given expression, we need to find the extreme values of the ratio of x to y, which are its minimum and maximum. The minimum occurs when x is 2/5 and y is 3/8, giving us a value of 240/481.

The only point of the given three which is equidistant from the other two is (3, -2), so the fourth missing point must be the other endpoint of its axis, and the points (-2, 4) and (8, 4) must be endpoints of the same axis.\n\nThen the center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment between (-2, 4) and (8, 4), which is the point (3, 4). This means that the semi-horizontal axis has length 8 - 3 = 5, and the semi-vertical axis has length 4 - (-2) = 6.

        "answer": "Note that the product of x squared plus 1 and x to the eighth power minus x to the sixth power plus x to the fourth power minus x squared plus 1 is equal to x to the tenth power plus 1. Also, x to the tenth power plus 1 is a factor of x to the two thousand ten power plus 1 via the factorization of a to the nth power plus b to the nth power, which states that it equals a plus b times a to the n minus 1 power minus a to the n minus 2 power times b plus a to the n minus 3 power times b squared and so on until b to the n minus 1 power, where n is odd. So x to the tenth power plus 1 is a factor of x to the fifth power times x to the two thousand ten power plus 1, which equals x to the two thousand fifteen power plus x to the fifth power. \n\nWhen x to the two thousand fifteen power plus 1 is expressed as x to the two thousand fifteen power plus x to the fifth power minus x to the fifth power plus 1 and divided by x to the eighth power minus x to the sixth power plus x to the fourth power minus x squared plus 1, the remainder is minus x to the fifth power plus 1. \n\nThe answer is -x to the fifth power plus 1."

Beta, who did not attempt 300 points on the first day, had a positive integer score on each of the two days, and Beta's daily success ratio on each day was less than Alpha's on that day.

        "answer": "Let Beta's scores be a out of b on day one and c out of d on day two, so that 0 is less than a divided by b which is less than 8 divided by 15, 0 is less than c divided by d which is less than 7 divided by 10, and b plus d equals 500. Then 15 divided by 8 times a is less than b and 10 divided by 7 times c is less than d, so 15 divided by 8 times a plus 10 divided by 7 times c is less than b plus d which equals 500, and 21 times a plus 16 times c is less than 5600.\n\nBeta's two-day success ratio is greatest when a plus c is greatest. Let M equal a plus c and subtract 16M from both sides of the last inequality to obtain 5 times a is less than 5600 minus 16M. Because a is greater than 0, conclude that 5600 minus 16M is greater than 0, and M is less than 350. When M equals 349, 5 times a is less than 16, so a is less than or equal to 3.\n\nIf a equals 3, then b is greater than or equal to 6, but then d is less than or equal to 494 and c equals 346 so c divided by d is greater than or equal to 346 divided by 494 which is greater than 7 divided by 10. Notice that when a equals 2 and b equals 4, then a divided by b is less than 8 divided by 15 and c divided by d equals 347 divided by 496 which is less than 7 divided by 10.

Therefore, the equation f(x) = 0 must have two distinct roots. Let them be r1 and r2.\n\nSince f(f(x)) = 0 has three distinct roots, one of the equations f(x) = r1 or f(x) = r2 has one distinct root. Without loss of generality, assume that f(x) = r1 has one distinct root. Then f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c = r1 has one root. This means x^2 + 6x + c - r1 must be equal to (x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0, so c - r1 = 9. Hence, r1 = c - 9.\n\nSince r1 is a root of f(x) = 0, (c - 9)^2 + 6(c - 9) + c = 0. Expanding, we get c^2 - 11c + 27 = 0, so c = (11 \u00b1 sqrt(13)) / 2.\n\nIf c = (11 - sqrt(13)) / 2, then r1 = c - 9 = (-7 - sqrt(13)) / 2 and r2 = -6 - r1 = (-5 + sqrt(13)) / 2, so f(x) = x^2 + 6x + (11 - sqrt(13)) / 2 = (x + (7 + sqrt(13)) / 2) * (x + (5 - sqrt(13)) / 2) = (x + 3)^2 - (7 + sqrt(13)) / 2. The equation f(x) = r1 has a double root of x = -3, and the equation f(x) = r2 has two roots, so f(f(x)) = 0 has exactly three roots.\n\nIf c = (11 + sqrt(13)) / 2, then r1 = c - 9 = (-7 + sqrt(13)) / 2 and r2 = -6 - r1 = (-5 - sqrt(13)) / 2, and f(x) = x^2 + 6x + (11 + sqrt(13)) / 2 = (x + (7 - sqrt(13)) / 2) * (x + (5 + sqrt(13)) / 2) = (x + 3)^2 + (-7 + sqrt(13)) / 2. The equation f(x) = r1 has a double root of x = -3, but the equation f(x) = r2 has no real roots, so f(f(x)) = 0 has exactly one root.\n\nTherefore, c = (11 - sqrt(13)) / 2."

Find the minimum possible value of a sub 1 plus a sub 2.",
        "answer": "The definition gives three equations: a3(a2+1) = a1+2009, a4(a3+1) = a2+2009, and a5(a4+1) = a3 + 2009. Subtracting consecutive equations yields two new equations: a3-a1 = (a3+1)(a4-a2) and a4-a2 = (a4+1)(a5-a3).\n\nSuppose that a3-a1 is not equal to 0. Then a4-a2 is not equal to 0, a5-a3 is not equal to 0, and so on. Because the absolute value of a(n+2) + 1 is greater than or equal to 2, it follows that the absolute value of a(n+3) - a(n+1) is less than the absolute value of a(n+2) - a(n). \n\nThen we have a series of inequalities: the absolute value of a3-a1 is greater than the absolute value of a4-a2, which is greater than the absolute value of a5-a3, and so on. This is a contradiction because it implies that the absolute values keep decreasing indefinitely.\n\nTherefore, a(n+2) - a(n) = 0 for all n greater than or equal to 1. This means that all terms with an odd index are equal, and all terms with an even index are equal. Thus, as long as a1 and a2 are integers, all the terms are integers. The definition of the sequence then implies that a1 = a3 = (a1+2009)/(a2+1), giving a1*a2 = 2009 = 7^2 * 41.\n\nThe minimum value of a1 + a2 occurs when {a1, a2} = {41, 49}, which has a sum of 90."

Applying this to the given expression, we get that the average of the square root of 25 plus x and the square root of 25 minus x is less than or equal to the square root of the average of 25 plus x and 25 minus x.

        "answer": "Our strategy is to take x^2 + y^2 + z^2 and divide it into several expressions, apply the AM-GM inequality to each expression, and come up with a multiple of 2xy sqrt(6) + 8yz.\n\nSince we want terms of xy and yz after applying AM-GM, we divide x^2 + y^2 + z^2 into (x^2 + ky^2) + ((1 - k)y^2 + z^2). By AM-GM, we get x^2 + ky^2 >= 2xy sqrt(k) and (1 - k)y^2 + z^2 >= 2yz sqrt(1 - k).\n\nTo get a multiple of 2xy sqrt(6) + 8yz, we want k so that 2 sqrt(k) / 2 sqrt(6) = 2 sqrt(1 - k) / 8. Then, we have sqrt(k) / sqrt(6) = sqrt(1 - k) / 4. Squaring both sides, we get k / 6 = (1 - k) / 16. Solving for k, we find k = 3/11.\n\nThus, x^2 + (3/11) y^2 >= 2xy sqrt(3/11) and (8/11) y^2 + z^2 >= 2yz sqrt(8/11) = 4yz sqrt(2/11). So, 1 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 >= 2xy sqrt(3/11) + 4yz sqrt(2/11). Multiplying by sqrt(11), we get 2xy sqrt(3) + 4yz sqrt(2) <= sqrt(11). Multiplying by sqrt(2), we get 2xy sqrt(6) + 8yz <= sqrt(22).\n\nEquality occurs when x = y sqrt(3/11) and y sqrt(8/11) = z. Using the condition x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, we can solve to get x = sqrt(3/22), y = sqrt(11/22), and z = sqrt(8/22). Therefore, the maximum value is sqrt(22)."

This sum can be separated into two parts: one with terms that have a multiple of 3 as their coefficient, and one with terms that have the square root of 3 as their coefficient.\n\nFrom this, we get two equations: one for the terms with multiples of 3 as coefficients, and one for the terms with the square root of 3 as coefficients. We can then use these equations to determine the values of the coefficients a0, a1, a2, and so on.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the coefficients a0, a1, a2, and so on, are all less than 3. This means that we can express the numbers 20 and 17 in base 3 to find the values of these coefficients.\n\nExpressing 20 in base 3 gives us 202, and expressing 17 in base 3 gives us 122. From this, we can determine that the function Q can be expressed as x^5 + 2x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x + 2.\n\nFinally, we can evaluate Q at x = 2 to get Q(2) = 2^5 + 2*2^4 + 2*2^3 + 2*2 + 2 = 32 + 32 + 16 + 4 + 2 = 86.

        "answer": "To find the focus of the given parabola, we start by completing the square on x in the equation y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3. \n\nWe can make the algebra easier by finding the focus of the parabola y = -3x^2, shifting it left by 1 unit to get y = -3(x + 1)^2, and then shifting it upward 3 units to find the focus of y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3.\n\nThe parabola y = -3x^2 is symmetric about the y-axis, so its focus is at a point of the form (0, f). Let y = d be the equation of the directrix.\n\nFor a point (x, -3x^2) on the parabola y = -3x^2, we can calculate the distance from the point to the focus and the distance from the point to the directrix.\n\nBy equating these distances and expanding the equation, we get two equations: 1 + 6f = 6d and f^2 = d^2. \n\nSolving these equations, we find that f = -1/12. So, the focus of y = -3x^2 is at (0, -1/12), the focus of y = -3(x + 1)^2 is at (-1, -1/12), and the focus of y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3 is at (-1, 3 - 1/12) which is (-1, 35/12).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (-1, 35/12)."

        "answer": "First, we consider a particular line, y = x - 1, which passes through point F. Substituting this into the equation of the ellipse, we get (x^2)/2 + (x - 1)^2 = 1. This simplifies to 3x^2 - 4x = 0, so x = 0 or x = 4/3. Thus, we can let point A = (4/3, 1/3) and point B = (0, -1).\n\nThe slope of line AP is then (1/3)/(4/3 - p) = 1/(4 - 3p), and the slope of line BP is (-1)/(-p) = 1/p. Since angle APF = angle BPF, these slopes are negatives of each other, so 1/(3p - 4) = -1/p. Then p = 3p - 4, so p = 2.\n\nFor a complete solution, we prove that this works for all chords AB that pass through F. Let A = (x_a, y_a) and B = (x_b, y_b). Then the condition angle APF = angle BPF is equivalent to y_a/(x_a - 2) + y_b/(x_b - 2) = 0, or y_a(x_b - 2) + y_b(x_a - 2) = 0. Then y_ax_b - 2y_a + y_bx_a - 2y_b = 0.\n\nLet y = m(x - 1) be the equation of line AB. Substituting, we get (x^2)/2 + m^2(x - 1)^2 = 1. This simplifies to (2m^2 + 1)x^2 - 4m^2x + 2m^2 - 2 = 0. By Vieta's formulas, x_a + x_b = (4m^2)/(2m^2 + 1) and x_ax_b = (2m^2 - 2)/(2m^2 + 1).\n\nThen y_ax_b - 2y_a + y_bx_a - 2y_b = m(x_a - 1)x_b - 2m(x_a - 1) + m(x_b - 1)x_a - 2m(x_b - 1) = 2mx_ax_b - 3m(x_a + x_b) + 4m = 2m((2m^2 - 2)/(2m^2 + 1)) - 3m((4m^2)/(2m^2 + 1)) + 4m = 0.\n\nThus, angle APF = angle BPF for all chords AB that pass through F.\n\nThe answer is 2."

However, we can simplify this expression into the form: ab(a - b)^2 + ac(a - c)^2 + ad(a - d)^2 + bc(b - c)^2 + bd(b - d)^2 + cd(c - d)^2 = 0.\n\nSince a, b, c, and d are all nonnegative, each term in this equation must be equal to 0. This leads to the conclusion that for any two variables among a, b, c, and d, either one of them is 0 or they are equal.\n\nAs a result, among a, b, c, and d, all the positive values must be equal. Each variable can be 0 or positive, resulting in 2^4 = 16 possible combinations.

The distance from this point to F1 can be calculated using the distance formula, which is the square root of (x^2 + 4). Similarly, the distance from this point to F2 can be calculated as the square root of ((x - 3)^2). \n\nSince the distance between F1 and F2 is 5, we have the equation square root of (x^2 + 4) + square root of ((x - 3)^2) = 5. This equation can also be written as square root of (x^2 + 4) + absolute value of (x - 3) = 5.\n\nWe can now consider two cases: when x is less than or equal to 3, and when x is greater than or equal to 3. \n\nIn the first case, when x is less than or equal to 3, we have square root of (x^2 + 4) + (3 - x) = 5.

This can be rewritten as minus 11 times p minus 20 over 11 squared plus 400 over 11, which is less than or equal to 400 over 11.\n\nEquality occurs when p equals 20 over 11.

        "answer": "Setting x equals pi, we get the inequality negative one raised to the power of n is greater than or equal to one over n, so n must be even. Let n equals two times m.\n\nSetting x equals pi over four, we get the inequality one over the square root of two raised to the power of two times m plus one over the square root of two raised to the power of two times m is greater than or equal to one over two times m. This simplifies to one over two raised to the power of m minus one is greater than or equal to one over two times m, so two raised to the power of m minus two is less than or equal to m. We see that m equals four is a solution, and the function two raised to the power of m minus two grows faster than m, so m equals four is the largest possible value of m.\n\nWe must then prove that the inequality sin x raised to the power of eight plus cos x raised to the power of eight is greater than or equal to one over eight for all real numbers x.\n\nBy the quadratic mean - arithmetic mean inequality, the square root of the expression sin x raised to the power of eight plus cos x raised to the power of eight over two is greater than or equal to sin x raised to the power of four plus cos x raised to the power of four over two, so sin x raised to the power of eight plus cos x raised to the power of eight is greater than or equal to the expression sin x raised to the power of four plus cos x raised to the power of four squared over two. Again by the quadratic mean - arithmetic mean inequality, the square root of the expression sin x raised to the power of four plus cos x raised to the power of four over two is greater than or equal to sin x squared plus cos x squared over two which equals one over two, so sin x raised to the power of four plus cos x raised to the power of four is greater than or equal to one over two. Therefore, sin x raised to the power of eight plus cos x raised to the power of eight is greater than or equal to one over eight.\n\nWe conclude that the largest such positive integer n is eight."

By using the quadratic formula, we get z equals one plus or minus the square root of one plus four times five minus five i, all divided by two. This simplifies to z equals one plus or minus the square root of twenty one minus twenty i, all divided by two.\n\nLet twenty one minus twenty i be equal to a plus bi squared, where a and b are real numbers. Expanding this gives a squared plus two abi minus b squared equals twenty one minus twenty i. Equating the real and imaginary parts, we get two equations: a squared minus b squared equals twenty one and ab equals minus ten. From the second equation, we can express b as minus ten divided by a.\n\nSubstituting b in the first equation gives a squared minus one hundred divided by a squared equals twenty one. Multiplying through by a squared gives a to the power of four minus twenty one a squared minus one hundred equals zero. This equation can be factored as a squared minus twenty five times a squared plus four equals zero.

Therefore, a + b + c = 2 - 17 + 43 = 28.\n\nAnother way to solve the problem is as follows: The graph of y = ax^2 + bx + c always passes through the point (1, a + b + c). In other words, a + b + c is the y-coordinate of the point on the parabola whose x-coordinate is 1. But this parabola is obtained by shifting the graph of y = 2x^2 - x + 7 four units to the right, so a + b + c is also the y-coordinate of the point on the original parabola whose x-coordinate is 1 - 4 = -3.

We can then express f(1) and f(i) using these complex numbers. \n\nSince f(1) and f(i) are real, we can equate the imaginary parts to zero, giving us the equations b + d + 1 = 0 and a + d - 1 = 0. Solving these equations gives us a = -d + 1 and b = -d - 1. \n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the magnitude of alpha and gamma, we get sqrt(a^2 + b^2) + sqrt(c^2 + d^2) = sqrt((-d + 1)^2 + (-d - 1)^2) + sqrt(c^2 + d^2) = sqrt(2d^2 + 2) + sqrt(c^2 + d^2). \n\nThis expression is greater than or equal to sqrt(2), with equality occurring when a = 1, b = -1, c = 0, and d = 0.

Finally, we may assume that x1 is less than or equal to x2, which is less than or equal to ... , which is less than or equal to x101, so that M equals x51.\n\nWe want to find the largest c such that the inequality x1 squared plus x2 squared plus ... plus x101 squared is greater than or equal to cx51 squared always holds, where x1 is less than or equal to x2, which is less than or equal to ... , which is less than or equal to x101 and x1 plus x2 plus ... plus x101 equals 0. Therefore, fixing a value of x51, we should write inequalities that minimize x1 squared plus x2 squared plus ... plus x101 squared.\n\nTo compare the terms on the left-hand side to x51 squared, we deal with the terms x1 squared plus x2 squared plus ... plus x50 squared and x51 squared plus x52 squared plus ... plus x101 squared separately.\n\nBy Cauchy-Schwarz, 50 times x1 squared plus x2 squared plus ... plus x50 squared is greater than or equal to the square of x1 plus x2 plus ... plus x50, so x1 squared plus x2 squared plus ... plus x50 squared is greater than or equal to one over 50 times the square of x1 plus x2 plus ... plus x50.\n\nWe have x1 plus x2 plus ... plus x50 equals negative x51 minus x52 - ... minus x101, which is less than or equal to negative 51 times x51 because x51 is less than or equal to x52, which is less than or equal to ... , which is less than or equal to x101. Since x51 is greater than 0, both x1 plus x2 plus ... plus x50 and negative 51 times x51 are negative, so we can write x1 squared plus x2 squared plus ... plus x50 squared is greater than or equal to one over 50 times the square of x1 plus x2 plus ... plus x50, which is greater than or equal to one over 50 times the square of negative 51 times x51, which equals 51 squared over 50 times x51 squared.\n\nOn the other hand, since 0 is less than x51, which is less than or equal to x52, which is less than or equal to ... , which is less than or equal to x101, we simply have x51 squared plus x52 squared plus ... plus x101 squared is greater than or equal to 51 times x51 squared.\n\nPutting all this together gives x1 squared plus x2 squared plus ... plus x50 squared plus x51 squared plus x52 squared plus ... plus x101 squared is greater than or equal to 51 squared over 50 plus 51 times x51 squared, which equals 5151 over 50 times x51 squared.\n\nEquality holds when x1 equals x2 equals ... equals x50 equals negative 51 over 50 and x51 equals x52 equals ... equals x101 equals 1, so the answer is 5151 over 50."

But f(x^2) = f(x)^2 - 2cx, so f(x)^2 - 2cx = x^2 + c^2. Hence, f(x)^2 = x^2 + 2cx + c^2 = (x + c)^2.\n\nSetting y = x, we get c = f(x)^2 - 2xf(x) + x^2, or f(x)^2 = -x^2 + 2xf(x) + c. From the previous equation, f(x)^2 = x^2 + 2cx + c^2, so -x^2 + 2xf(x) + c = x^2 + 2cx + c^2. Hence, 2xf(x) = 2x^2 + 2cx = 2x(x + c). So for x not equal to 0, f(x) = x + c.\n\nWe can then extend this to say f(x) = x + c for all x. Since c must be 0 or 1, the only possible solutions are f(x) = x and f(x) = x + 1.

        "answer": "The vertical asymptote of the function f(x) is x = 2. Hence, the value of d is 2.\n\nUsing long division, the function f(x) can be expressed as f(x) = (1/2)x - 2 - 2/(2x - 4). Thus, the oblique asymptote of f(x) is y = (1/2)x - 2, which passes through the point (0, -2). Therefore, the oblique asymptote of g(x) is y = -2x - 2.\n\nThe function g(x) can be written as g(x) = -2x - 2 + k/(x - 2) for some constant k. To find the value of k, we use the fact that f(-2) = -11/4. So, g(-2) = -2(-2) - 2 + k/(-2 - 2) = -11/4. Solving this equation, we find that k = 19.\n\nHence, the function g(x) can be expressed as g(x) = -2x - 2 + 19/(x - 2) = (-2x^2 + 2x + 23)/(x - 2). We want to solve the equation (x^2 - 6x + 6)/(2x - 4) = (-2x^2 + 2x + 23)/(x - 2).\n\nThis equation simplifies to x^2 - 6x + 6 = -4x^2 + 4x + 46, or 5x^2 - 10x - 40 = 0. Factoring this equation, we get 5(x + 2)(x - 4) = 0, so the other point of intersection occurs at x = 4. Since f(4) = (4^2 - 6*4 + 6)/(2*4 - 4) = -1/2, the other point of intersection is (4, -1/2).\n\nTherefore, the other point of intersection is (4, -1/2)."

        "answer": "The graph of the given equation is a parabola with its vertex at the point (y/2, -y^2/4). \n\nTo find the maximum value of the expression |x^2 - xy|, we divide into cases based on the value of y.\n\nIf y is less than or equal to 0, then the maximum value occurs at x = 1, which is 1 - y.\n\nIf y is between 0 and 1, then we have two cases: \n- For 0 \u2264 x \u2264 y, the maximum value is y^2/4.\n- For y \u2264 x \u2264 1, the maximum value is 1 - y.\n\nIf y is greater than or equal to 1, then we have two cases: \n- For 1 \u2264 y \u2264 2, the maximum value is y^2/4.\n- For y \u2265 2, the maximum value is y - 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the maximum values for each case:\n- For y \u2264 0, the maximum value is 1 - y, which is at least 1.\n- For 1 \u2264 y \u2264 2, the maximum value is y^2/4, which is at least 1/4.\n- For y \u2265 2, the maximum value is y - 1, which is at least 1.\n\nFor 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1, we compare y^2/4 and 1 - y. By solving the inequality y^2/4 \u2265 1 - y, we get y^2 + 4y - 4 \u2265 0. The solutions to this equation are -2 \u00b1 2\u221a2. \n- For 0 \u2264 y \u2264 -2 + 2\u221a2, the maximum value is 1 - y.\n- For -2 + 2\u221a2 \u2264 y \u2264 1, the maximum value is y^2/4.\n\nThe minimum value of the maximum value occurs at y = -2 + 2\u221a2, which is 1 - (-2 + 2\u221a2) = 3 - 2\u221a2.

        "answer": "We consider cases. Either the exponent is 0, or the base must be either 1 or -1. These are the only ways that a^b = 1 is possible if a and b are real numbers. Also, if the base is -1, then the exponent must be an even integer.\n\nNote that the first two cases use the formula for the sum of the roots of a quadratic. A short derivation follows in case you are not familiar with them.\n\nIf p and q are roots of the quadratic x^2 + bx + c, then the sum of roots p + q equals -b and the product of roots pq equals c. \n\nIf you have a quadratic where the leading coefficient is not 1, then it can be written in the form ax^2 + bx + c. Since to find the roots we set it equal to 0, we can divide the entire thing by a to get x^2 + (b/a)x + (c/a) = 0. Similar to the case where the leading coefficient is 1, the sum of roots p + q will now be -b/a and the product of roots pq will now be c/a.\n\nThere are three cases to consider. \n\nFirst case: The exponent is 0 when 0 = x^2 - 5x + 2. Note that the discriminant of this quadratic equation is 17, which is positive, thus there are two distinct real roots. By the formula, they add up to 5. Furthermore, note that neither of these roots is also a root of x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0, so we don't have to worry about getting 0^0 in our original equation. Thus we have our first two solutions, and they add up to 5.\n\nSecond case: The base is 1 when 0 = x^2 - 4x + 1. Again, this equation has a positive discriminant and thus two real roots. By the formula, these roots add up to 4. Both are automatically solutions to our original equation, since 1^b = 1 for all real b.\n\nThird case: The base is -1 when 0 = x^2 - 4x + 3. This gives us potential solutions of x = 1 and x = 3, but we'd better check them. As it turns out x = 1 gives (-1)^-2 = 1 and x = 3 gives (-1)^-4 = 1, so both are solutions to our original equation.\n\nThus we have six solutions in all. The first two added up to 5, the next two added up to 4, and the last two added up to 4, so the sum of the six solutions is 13."

        "answer": "The given equation can be simplified by expressing the square root of (2 - sqrt(3))^x in terms of y. We have y = sqrt((2 + sqrt(3))^x), then sqrt((2 - sqrt(3))^x) = sqrt(1 / (2 + sqrt(3))^x) = 1 / sqrt((2 + sqrt(3))^x) = 1 / y. So the given equation becomes y + 1/y = 4. \n\nThen y^2 + 1 = 4y, or y^2 - 4y + 1 = 0. By the quadratic formula, y = 2 +/- sqrt(3). Thus, sqrt((2 + sqrt(3))^x) = 2 +/- sqrt(3). For the + root, sqrt((2 + sqrt(3))^x) = 2 + sqrt(3), so x = 2. For the - root, sqrt((2 + sqrt(3))^x) = 2 - sqrt(3) = 1 / (2 + sqrt(3)) = (2 + sqrt(3))^(-1), so x = -2. \n\nThus, the solutions are 2 and -2. The answer is 2, -2."

The distance between the center and one vertex is 3 units, and the distance between the center and one focus is the square root of 34 units.

        "answer": "We claim that the function F(n) is equal to 2 raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by 2 raised to the power of n, for all nonnegative integers n. We prove this using strong induction.\n\nFirst, we verify that the result holds for n = 0 and n = 1. Then, we assume that the result holds for n = 0, 1, 2, and so on, up to some nonnegative integer k greater than or equal to 1. This means that F(k - 1) is equal to 2 raised to the power of k - 1 minus 1 divided by 2 raised to the power of k - 1, and F(k) is equal to 2 raised to the power of k minus 1 divided by 2 raised to the power of k.\n\nUsing this assumption, we can calculate F(k + 1) as follows: F(k + 1) is equal to 5 divided by 2 times F(k) minus F(k - 1). By substituting the expressions for F(k) and F(k - 1), we get F(k + 1) is equal to 5 divided by 2 times the quantity 2 raised to the power of k minus 1 divided by 2 raised to the power of k, minus the quantity 2 raised to the power of k - 1 minus 1 divided by 2 raised to the power of k - 1.\n\nAfter simplifying, we get F(k + 1) is equal to 2 raised to the power of k + 1 minus 1 divided by 2 raised to the power of k + 1. This shows that the result holds for n = k + 1. By induction, we conclude that the result holds for all nonnegative integers n.\n\nNow, we want to find the sum of 1 divided by F(2 raised to the power of n), from n = 0 to infinity. We can rewrite F(2 raised to the power of n) as 2 raised to the power of 2 raised to the power of n minus 1 divided by 2 raised to the power of 2 raised to the power of n. So, the sum becomes the sum of 2 raised to the power of 2 raised to the power of n divided by the quantity 2 raised to the power of 2 raised to the power of n squared minus 1, from n = 0 to infinity.\n\nLet's denote 2 raised to the power of 2 raised to the power of n as x. Then, the summand becomes x divided by x squared minus 1. We can rewrite this as the quantity x + 1 minus 1 divided by x squared minus 1. This is equal to the quantity x + 1 divided by x squared minus 1 minus 1 divided by x squared minus 1.\n\nBy factoring the denominator, we get 1 divided by x - 1 minus 1 divided by x squared minus 1. Substituting back x = 2 raised to the power of 2 raised to the power of n, we get 1 divided by 2 raised to the power of 2 raised to the power of n minus 1 minus 1 divided by 2 raised to the power of 2 raised to the power of n + 1 minus 1.\n\nThe sum telescopes, meaning that most terms cancel out when we expand the sum. We are left with 1 divided by 2 raised to the power of 2 raised to the power of 0 minus 1, which is equal to 1. Therefore, the final answer is 1."

This simplification leads to the conclusion that (1 + i)^99 equals -2^49 + 2^49i.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the real parts of the terms in the given series is the real part of the expression (1 + i)^99, which equals -2^49. \n\nThe answer is -2^49."

Therefore, we find that x plus 2y is greater than or equal to 3 plus 6 times the square root of 2.\n\nTo achieve equality, the square of x plus 2 must be equal to 2 times the square of y plus 2, which implies that x plus 2 is equal to y plus 2 times the square root of 2.

        "question": "Find the equation of the directrix of the parabola y equals 8 x squared plus 2.",
        "answer": "The parabola y = 8x^2 is symmetric about the y-axis, which means the focus is at a point of the form (0, f). Let y = d be the equation of the directrix. \n\nFor a point (x, 8x^2) on the parabola y = 8x^2, the distance from the point to the focus is given by PF^2 = x^2 + (8x^2 - f)^2, and the distance from the point to the directrix is given by PQ^2 = (8x^2 - d)^2. \n\nSince the parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus F and the directrix, we have x^2 + (8x^2 - f)^2 = (8x^2 - d)^2. \n\nExpanding this equation gives x^2 + 64x^4 - 16fx^2 + f^2 = 64x^4 - 16dx^2 + d^2. Matching the coefficients of the corresponding terms, we get two equations: 1 - 16f = -16d and f^2 = d^2. \n\nFrom the first equation, f - d = 1/16. Since f^2 = d^2, we have f = d or f = -d. However, we cannot have f = d, so f = -d. Then -2d = 1/16, which gives d = -1/32.\n\nThe equation of the directrix of y = 8x^2 is y = -1/32. To find the equation of the directrix of y = 8x^2 + 2, we shift the directrix of y = 8x^2 upward by 2 units, giving the equation of the directrix as y = -1/32 + 2 = 63/32.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the directrix of the parabola y = 8x^2 + 2 is y = 63/32."

This simplifies to ((x^2 + 2)^2 - (x^4 + 4)) / (x * (x^2 + 2 + square root of (x^4 + 4))). \n\nAfter further simplification, we get (4x^2) / (x * (x^2 + 2 + square root of (x^4 + 4))), which can also be written as 4 / ((1/x) * (x^2 + 2 + square root of (x^4 + 4))).

        "answer": "The problem provides the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle and its inradius. Given that a right triangle has legs x and y, and hypotenuse z, the inradius is (x + y - z) / 2. \n\nUsing this information and the given diagram, we can determine the lengths of the sides of triangle OCF. The diameter of the incircle of triangle OCF is OC + OF - CF = 2. Since OC = b, OF = 6, and CF = a, we can write the equation as b + 6 - a = 2, which simplifies to a - b = 4.\n\nWe are also given the equation a^2 - b^2 = 36. By factoring the left-hand side of this equation, we get (a + b)(a - b) = 36. Substituting a - b = 4 into this equation, we find that a + b = 36 / (a - b) = 36 / 4 = 9.\n\nNow we have two equations: a - b = 4 and a + b = 9. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. Adding the two equations, we get 2a = 13, so a = 13 / 2. Substituting a = 13 / 2 into the equation a - b = 4, we find that b = 5 / 2.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the product of the lengths of the sides AB and CD. AB = 2a = 2 * (13 / 2) = 13, and CD = 2b = 2 * (5 / 2) = 5. Therefore, (AB)(CD) = 13 * 5 = 65.\n\nThe answer is 65."

Then, xy(72 - 3x - 4y) is less than or equal to 1152. Equality occurs when 3x equals 4y, and both equal 72 - 3x - 4y. Solving for x and y gives x equals 8 and y equals 6, so the maximum value is 1152."

The fraction 1/m(m + n + 1) can be expressed as 1/(n + 1) * (1/m - 1/(m + n + 1)). \n\nThus, the sum of the series from m = 1 to infinity of 1/m(m + n + 1) can be expressed as the sum of the series from m = 1 to infinity of 1/(n + 1) * (1/m - 1/(m + n + 1)).\n\nBy expanding this series, we get 1/(n + 1) * (1 - 1/(n + 2) + 1/2 - 1/(n + 3) + 1/3 - 1/(n + 4) + ...).\n\nThis simplifies to 1/(n + 1) * (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(n + 1)).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the series from m = 1 to infinity and n = 1 to infinity of 1/mn(m + n + 1) can be expressed as the sum of the series from n = 1 to infinity of 1/n(n + 1) * (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(n + 1)).\n\nBy further simplifying this expression, we can break it down into two separate sums: the sum of the series from n = 1 to infinity of 1/n(n + 1) and the sum of the series from n = 1 to infinity and k = 2 to n + 1 of 1/kn(n + 1).\n\nThe first sum is a telescoping series that simplifies to 1.

        "answer": "We can write the given equation as z squared minus 4z equals negative 19 plus 8i. Then z squared minus 4z plus 4 equals negative 15 plus 8i, so z minus 2 squared equals negative 15 plus 8i.\n\nLet negative 15 plus 8i equals a plus bi squared, where a and b are real numbers. Expanding, we get negative 15 plus 8i equals a squared plus 2abi minus b squared. Setting the real and imaginary parts equal, we get a squared minus b squared equals negative 15 and ab equals 4. Hence, b equals 4 divided by a, so a squared minus 16 divided by a squared equals negative 15. Then a to the power of 4 minus 16 equals negative 15a squared, so a to the power of 4 plus 15a squared minus 16 equals 0. This factors as a squared minus 1 times a squared plus 16 equals 0. Since a is real, a equals plus or minus 1, which leads to b equals plus or minus 4. Thus, z minus 2 equals plus or minus 1 plus 4i, then z equals 3 plus 4i or z equals 1 minus 4i.

In that case, P(x) must be divisible by the polynomial that is the product of the two binomials x minus the square root of 2 minus the square root of 5 and x minus the square root of 2 plus the square root of 5, which equals x squared minus 2 times x times the square root of 2 minus 3. \n\nNow we see that if we multiply this polynomial by the polynomial x squared plus 2 times x times the square root of 2 minus 3, we get a polynomial with rational coefficients, which equals x to the fourth power minus 14 times x squared plus 9. \n\nTherefore, P(x) equals x to the fourth power minus 14 times x squared plus 9, and so P(1) equals 1 minus 14 plus 9, which equals -4."

The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the square root of ((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).

To find the distance from point A to the line x - y - 8 = 0, we use the formula for the distance between a point and a line, which is given by the absolute value of the difference between the x and y coordinates of the point and the equation of the line, divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients of x and y in the equation of the line. \n\nIn this case, the distance is |a - (a^2 - 9a + 25) - 8| divided by the square root of 2.

This expression is minimized when (a - 5)^2 is zero, which occurs when a is equal to 5.

So, we have d = 2 / (x + 1) - x and d = (x + 1) / (2x) - 2 / (x + 1).\n\nBy equating the expressions for d, we get the equation 4x - 2x^2 * (x + 1) = (x + 1)^2 - 4x, which simplifies to 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.

        "answer": "The condition that the absolute difference of consecutive terms equals the term after that implies that terms three positions apart have the same parity. Given that the 2006th term is odd, the second term must also be odd. Since the 2006th term equals one, and every term is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of the first two terms, it follows that the greatest common divisor of the first two terms is one. There are 499 odd integers between one and 998, of which 166 are multiples of three, 13 are multiples of 37, and four are multiples of both. Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, there are at most 499 minus 166 minus 13 plus four equals 324 possible values for the second term. \n\nThis can be proven to be the exact number of possibilities by noting that for any term after the second, its value is less than the maximum of the two preceding terms, provided both preceding terms are positive.

        "answer": "Substituting the definition of f and g into h(x) = f(g(x)), we get h(x) = ag(x) + b = a(-3x+5) + b = -3ax + (5a+b).\n\nSince the inverse of h, denoted as h inverse, is given by adding 7 to x, the inverse of h inverse is given by subtracting 7. Therefore, h(x) equals x minus 7. We can test this by substituting h(h inverse(x)) = (x+7) - 7 = x.\n\nCombining these two expressions for h, we get -3ax + (5a+b) = x - 7. From here, we could solve for a and b and find a - b, but we notice that the substitution x = 2 gives -6a + (5a+b) = 2 - 7, or b - a = -5. Therefore, a - b = 5. The answer is 5."

        "answer": "The inequality given is for all real numbers x. This means the expression must be non-negative for all values of x. \n\nFirst, we simplify the given inequality to get ax^6 + ax^4 + bx^3 - (a + b)x^2 + bx - a - b >= 0. \n\nThen we factor this expression to get (x - 1)(x^2 + 1)(ax^3 + ax^2 + ax + a + b) >= 0.\n\nFor this inequality to hold for all real numbers x, ax^3 + ax^2 + ax + a + b must have a factor of x - 1, because if it does not, then as x increases from just below 1 to just above 1, x - 1 changes sign, but (x^2 + 1)(ax^3 + ax^2 + ax + a + b) does not, meaning that it cannot be non-negative for all real numbers x.\n\nSo we set x = 1 and get a + a + a + a + b = 0, which gives us 4a + b = 0.\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is -b/a.

The sequence of numbers 84, 89, 94, and so on, up to 1004, forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 5. Since 1004 - 84 = 920, which is equal to 184 times 5, this sequence has 184 + 1 = 185 terms. Therefore, we need to apply f 185 times to 84 to reach 1004.\n\nOnce we have f^185(1004), we start using both parts (1) and (2) of the definition to simplify the expression.

        "answer": "Squaring the equation p + q + r + s = 8, we get p squared plus q squared plus r squared plus s squared plus 2 times the sum of pq, pr, ps, qr, qs, and rs equals 64. Hence, p squared plus q squared plus r squared plus s squared equals 64 minus 2 times 12, which equals 40.\n\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the sum of 1 squared, 1 squared, and 1 squared times the sum of p squared, q squared, and r squared is greater than or equal to the sum of p, q, and r squared. Then, 3 times the quantity 40 minus s squared is greater than or equal to the quantity 8 minus s squared. Expanding this, we get 120 minus 3 times s squared is greater than or equal to 64 minus 16 times s plus s squared, so 4 times s squared minus 16 times s minus 56 is less than or equal to 0. Dividing by 4, we get s squared minus 4 times s minus 14 is less than or equal to 0. By the quadratic formula, the roots of the corresponding equation x squared minus 4 times x minus 14 equals 0 are x equals 2 plus or minus 3 times the square root of 2, so s is less than or equal to 2 plus 3 times the square root of 2.\n\nEquality occurs when p equals q equals r equals 2 minus the square root of 2, so the maximum value of s is 2 plus 3 times the square root of 2. \n\nThe final answer is: 2 plus 3 times the square root of 2"

Applying this to the numbers x and y, we get (x + y)/2 is greater than or equal to 2/(1/x + 1/y), which simplifies to 2xy/(x + y). This implies that (x + y)/xy is greater than or equal to 4/(x + y). \n\nFurthermore, we can divide both sides of the inequality by z to get (x + y)/xyz is greater than or equal to 4/((x + y)z). The AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean of two numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same two numbers. Applying this to the numbers (x + y) and z, we get the square root of ((x + y)z) is less than or equal to (x + y + z)/2, which is equal to 1/2. \n\nSquaring both sides, we get (x + y)z is less than or equal to 1/4.

We are given the factorization of the sum of cubes, which allows us to express the sum of the cubes of the roots in terms of the coefficients. Using the given equations, we find that the sum of the cubes of the roots is equal to the sum of the cubes of the values alpha, beta, and gamma, plus three times the difference between the product of the roots and the product of the values alpha, beta, and gamma. \n\nSince alpha, beta, and gamma are the cube roots of 13, 53, and 103 respectively, we can find the sum of the cubes of these values, which is 13 + 53 + 103 = 170, and the product of the roots is equal to the product of alpha, beta, and gamma plus one-third. Therefore, the sum of the cubes of the roots r, s, and t is equal to 170 plus three times the difference between the product of the roots and the product of alpha, beta, and gamma.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get the sum of the cubes of the roots r, s, and t as 170. \n\nThe answer is 170."

        "answer": "The expression can be simplified using the change of base formula. The expression is equivalent to a series of logarithmic fractions, where most of the terms cancel each other out, leaving only the logarithm of b divided by the logarithm of a, which equals the logarithm of b with base a. \n\nGiven that the logarithm of b with base a equals 2, it means that b is equal to a squared. The problem also states that there are 870 logarithms in the expression, so the difference between b and a is 870. By substituting b with a squared, we get the equation a squared minus a equals 870. \n\nSolving the quadratic equation a squared minus a minus 870 equals 0, we find that it can be factored into a minus 30 times a plus 29 equals 0. Since a must be a positive number, we take a equals 30. Then, we find that b equals a squared, which is 900. \n\nFinally, adding a and b together, we get 30 plus 900, which equals 930."

Since q(x) is a square, it is always non-negative, so we must have y greater than or equal to 0.\n\nIf we assume y is greater than or equal to 0, we can rewrite the equation as y = (x^2 + 2)^2. Taking the square root of both sides gives us the square root of y = x^2 + 2.

Substituting, the right-hand side becomes \n(b^2)^(1/3) + (a^4 / (64b^2))^(1/3) + 2 * (ab)^(1/3) - 2 * (a * (a^2 / (8b)))^(1/3) = \n(b^2)^(1/3) + (a / (4b)) * (ab)^(1/3) + 2 * (ab)^(1/3) - (a / b) * (b^2)^(1/3) = \n(1 - a/b) * (b^2)^(1/3) + (a/(4b) + 2) * (ab)^(1/3).\n\nAt this point, we could try to be systematic, but it's easier to test some small values. For example, we could try taking b = 2, to capture the (4^(1/3)) term. This gives us \n(1 - a/2) * (4^(1/3)) + (a/8 + 2) * (2a)^(1/3). \nThen taking a = 20 gives us exactly what we want: \n(1 - 20/2) * (4^(1/3)) + (20/8 + 2) * (40)^(1/3) = 9 * (5^(1/3)) - 9 * (4^(1/3)).\n\nThen c = a^2 / (8b) = 25. Thus, a + b + c = 20 + 2 + 25 = 47."

        "answer": "The expression x2(x1+x3) is not symmetric in the roots x1, x2, x3, so Vieta's formulas can't be used directly to find its value. We hope that we can determine some of the values of the roots explicitly. Letting a be the square root of 2014, the equation becomes ax3 - (2a2+1)x2 + 2 = 0. We can rearrange this as (ax3-x2) - (2a2x2-2) = 0, or x2(ax-1) - 2(ax-1)(ax+1) = 0. Therefore, we have (ax-1)(x2-2ax-2) = 0. It follows that one of the roots of the equation is x = 1/a, and the other two roots satisfy the quadratic x2 - 2ax - 2 = 0. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of the quadratic is -2, which is negative, so one of the roots must be negative and the other must be positive. Furthermore, the sum of the roots is 2a, so the positive root must be greater than 2a. Since 2a is greater than 1/a, it follows that 1/a is the middle root of the equation. That is, x2 = 1/a.\n\nThen x1 and x3 are the roots of x2-2ax-2=0, so by Vieta, x1+x3 = 2a. Thus, x2(x1+x3) = 1/a * 2a = 2. \n\nThe final answer is: 2"

Let the quotient of the division be q(x). Then x^5 - x^4 - x^3 + x^2 + x = (x^2 - 4)(x + 1)q(x) + ax^2 + bx + c.\n\nWe can see that our divisor has roots x = 2, x = -2, and x = -1. Plugging in these roots gives us equations: \nFor x = 2 we have 32 - 16 - 8 + 4 + 2 = 0 + 4a + 2b + c which gives us 4a + 2b + c = 14.\nFor x = -2 we have -32 - 16 + 8 + 4 - 2 = 0 + 4a - 2b + c which gives us 4a - 2b + c = -38.\nFor x = -1 we have -1 - 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 0 + a - b + c which gives us a - b + c = -1.\n\nSolving these three equations gives us a = -8, b = 13, and c = 20.\nSo our remainder is -8x^2 + 13x + 20."

        "answer": "The solution to the given problem is obtained by subtracting the two equations y + xz = 10 and z + xy = 10.

This further simplifies to (y - z)(1 - x) = 0, indicating that either y = z or x = 1.\n\nIf x = 1, then the equations yz = 6 and y + z = 10 are obtained. Using Vieta's formulas, it is found that y and z are the roots of the quadratic equation t^2 - 10t + 6 = 0. This means that there are two ordered triples (x, y, z) for which x = 1.\n\nIf y = z, then two equations are obtained: x + y^2 = 7 and y + xy = 10.

        "answer": "The given equation is 2004(x^3 - 3xy^2) - 2005(y^3 - 3x^2y) = 0. Dividing both sides by y^3 and setting t = x/y yields 2004(t^3 - 3t) - 2005(1 - 3t^2) = 0. A quick check shows that this cubic has three real roots. Since the three roots are precisely x1/y1, x2/y2, and x3/y3, we must have 2004(t^3 - 3t) - 2005(1 - 3t^2) = 2004(t - x1/y1)(t - x2/y2)(t - x3/y3). Therefore, (1 - x1/y1)(1 - x2/y2)(1 - x3/y3) = (2004(1 - 3) - 2005(1 - 3))/2004 = (2004(-2) - 2005(-2))/2004 = (-4008 + 4010)/2004 = 2/2004 = 1/1002. \n\nThe answer is 1/1002."

Since a7 equals a1 and a8 equals a2, the sequence repeats every six terms, meaning that the term that is six positions after any term is equal to that term.\n\nWe are also given that the sum of any six consecutive terms in the sequence equals zero. Since 1492 is four more than a multiple of six, the sum of the first 1492 terms is equal to the sum of the first four terms: x + y + (y - x) + (-x) = 2y - x, which equals 1985.\n\nSimilarly, since 1985 is five more than a multiple of six, the sum of the first 1985 terms equals the sum of the first five terms: x + y + (y - x) + (-x) + (-y) = y - x, which equals 1492. By subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we can determine that y = 493.\n\nSince 2001 is three more than a multiple of six, we know that the sum of the first 2001 terms equals the sum of the first three terms: x + y + (y - x) = 2y = 2 * 493 = 986."

By comparing the coefficients of the powers of x on both sides, we get a system of equations: a + c = 0, ac + b + d = 0, ad + bc = -4, and bd = -1.\n\nFrom the first equation, we find that c = -a. Substituting this into the other equations, we get -a^2 + b + d = 0, ad - ab = -4, and bd = -1. Solving these equations, we find that b = (a^3 + 4)/(2a) and d = (a^3 - 4)/(2a).\n\nSubstituting these expressions for b and d into the equation bd = -1, we get (a^3 + 4)(a^3 - 4)/(4a^2) = -1. Simplifying this equation, we get a^6 + 4a^2 - 16 = 0. Factoring this equation, we get (a^2 - 2)(a^4 + 2a^2 + 8) = 0.\n\nSolving for a, we find that a can be sqrt(2). Substituting this value of a back into the expressions for b, c, and d, we find that b = 1 + sqrt(2), c = -sqrt(2), and d = 1 - sqrt(2).

        "answer": "Since q(x) is a quadratic, and we have a horizontal asymptote at y = 0, we know that p(x) must be linear.\n\nSince we have a hole at x = 1, there must be a factor of x - 1 in both p(x) and q(x). Additionally, since there is a vertical asymptote at x = -1, the denominator q(x) must have a factor of x + 1. Then, p(x) = a(x - 1) and q(x) = b(x + 1)(x - 1), for some constants a and b.\n\nSince p(2) = 1, we have a(2 - 1) = 1 and hence a = 1. Since q(2) = 3, we have b(2 + 1)(2 - 1) = 3 and hence b = 1.\n\nSo p(x) = x - 1 and q(x) = (x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1, so p(x) + q(x) = x^2 + x - 2. \n\nThe answer is x^2 + x - 2."

To graph ||x| - |y|| = 1, notice that the equation does not change if we replace x by -x or if we replace y by -y. Thus, the graph of ||x| - |y|| = 1 is symmetric about the y-axis and the x-axis, so if we graph the equation in just the first quadrant, we can produce the remainder of the graph by reflecting it over the axes.\n\nIf (x, y) lies in the first quadrant, then x is greater than or equal to 0 and y is greater than or equal to 0, so the equation ||x| - |y|| = 1 becomes just |x-y| = 1. Therefore, either x-y = 1 or y-x = 1, whose graphs in the first quadrant are rays.

        "answer": "We can let the factorization be x squared plus bx plus 2008, which is equal to (x plus p)(x plus q), where p and q are integers. Then, p plus q equals b and pq equals 2008.\n\nThe equation pq equals 2008 tells us that either both p and q are positive, or both are negative. Since p plus q equals b is positive, both p and q are positive.\n\nWe want to find the minimum value of b. The number b equals p plus q is minimized when p and q are as close as possible, under the condition pq equals 2008. This occurs when p and q are 8 and 251, so the smallest possible value of b is 8 plus 251, which equals 259. \n\nThe answer is 259."

        "answer": "We can write the equation r to the power of 5 minus 1 equals 0, which factors as (r minus 1)(r to the power of 4 plus r to the power of 3 plus r to the power of 2 plus r plus 1) equals 0. Since r is not equal to 1, r to the power of 4 plus r to the power of 3 plus r to the power of 2 plus r plus 1 equals 0.\n\nTo compute the product, we can arrange the factors in pairs. The product of (r minus 1)(r to the power of 2 minus 1)(r to the power of 3 minus 1)(r to the power of 4 minus 1) is equal to (r to the power of 5 minus r minus r to the power of 4 plus 1)(r to the power of 5 minus r to the power of 2 minus r to the power of 3 plus 1).\n\nAfter simplifying and combining like terms, we get 4 minus 2r to the power of 2 minus 2r to the power of 3 minus 2r plus r to the power of 3 plus r to the power of 4 minus 2r to the power of 4 plus r to the power of 6 plus r to the power of 7.\n\nFurther simplification leads to 4 minus 2r to the power of 2 minus 2r to the power of 3 minus 2r plus r to the power of 3 plus r to the power of 4 minus 2r to the power of 4 plus r plus r to the power of 2, which equals 4 minus r minus r to the power of 2 minus r to the power of 3 minus r to the power of 4.\n\nFinally, this simplifies to 5 minus (1 plus r plus r to the power of 2 plus r to the power of 3 plus r to the power of 4), which equals 5. \n\nThe answer is 5."

        "question": "In the complex plane, z, z squared, z cubed form, in some order, three of the vertices of a non-degenerate square, what are all possible areas of the square.",
        "answer": "The problem asks us to find the possible areas of a square formed by the complex numbers z, z^2, and z^3. \n\nFirst, consider the case where z is between z^2 and z^3. We have two possible diagrams. In the first diagram, z^3 - z = i(z^2 - z), and in the second diagram, z^3 - z = -i(z^2 - z). This gives us the equation z^3 - z = \u00b1i(z^2 - z). Factoring this equation, we get z(z - 1)(z + 1) = \u00b1iz(z - 1). Since z is not equal to 0 and 1, we can safely divide both sides by z(z - 1) to get z + 1 = \u00b1i. \n\nFor z = -1 + i, the area of the square is |z^2 - z|^2 = |z|^2 |z - 1|^2 = |-1 + i|^2 |-2 + i|^2 = 10. For z = -1 - i, the area of the square is |z^2 - z|^2 = |z|^2 |z - 1|^2 = |-1 - i|^2 |-2 - i|^2 = 10.\n\nAnother case is where z^2 is between z and z^3. This gives us the equation z^3 - z^2 = \u00b1i(z - z^2). Factoring this equation, we get z^2(z - 1) = \u00b1iz(z - 1). Then z = \u00b1i. For z = i, the area of the square is |z^2 - z|^2 = |z|^2 |z - 1|^2 = |i|^2 |i - 1|^2 = 2. For z = -i, the area of the square is |z^2 - z|^2 = |z|^2 |z - 1|^2 = |-i|^2 |-i - 1|^2 = 2.\n\nThe final case is where z^3 is between z and z^2. This gives us the equation z^3 - z^2 = \u00b1i(z^3 - z). Factoring this equation, we get z^2(z - 1) = \u00b1iz(z - 1)(z + 1). Then z = \u00b1i(z + 1). Solving z = i(z + 1), we find z = (-1 + i)/2. Then the area of the square is |z^3 - z^2|^2 = |z|^4 |z - 1|^2 = |(-1 + i)/2|^4 |(-3 + i)/2|^2 = 5/8. Solving z = -i(z + 1), we find z = (-1 - i)/2. Then the area of the square is |z^3 - z^2|^2 = |z|^4 |z - 1|^2 = |(-1 - i)/2|^4 |(-3 - i)/2|^2 = 5/8.\n\nTherefore, the possible areas of the square are 5/8, 2, and 10."

        "answer": "Note that 2010 can be expressed as a difference of squares, which can be factored into (a-b)(a+b) + (c-d)(c+d). If either a-b is greater than 1 or c-d is greater than 1, then the sum of these products will exceed 2010, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, a-b and c-d must both equal 1. \n\nTo satisfy this condition, we set b equal to a-1 and d equal to c-1.

Let x1 and x2 be the roots of this quadratic, so by Vieta's formulas, x1 + x2 = 2 and x1 * x2 = -k.\n\nThe two vertices on the parabola are then (x1, 2x1 + k) and (x2, 2x2 + k), and the square of the distance between them is 5(x1 - x2)^2 = 5((x1 + x2)^2 - 4x1*x2) = 5(4 + 4k) = 20(k + 1).\n\nThe point (0, k) lies on the line y = 2x + k, and its distance to the line y - 2x + 17 = 0 is |k + 17| / sqrt(5).

Hence, k = 3 or k = 63.\n\nWe want to find the smallest possible area of the square, so we take k = 3. This gives us 20(k + 1) = 80. \n\nThe answer is 80."

Substituting, we get (x - 4)^2 + (225 - 9x^2)/25 = 9/4.\n\nThis simplifies to 64x^2 - 800x + 2275 = 0, which factors as (8x - 65)(8x - 35) = 0. Since x is less than or equal to 5, x = 35/8.

We can take y = 3*sqrt(15)/8.\n\nThus, the slope of line AB is (3*sqrt(15)/8) / (35/8 - 4) = sqrt(15), so its equation is y = sqrt(15)*(x - 4).\n\nTo find B, we substitute into the equation of the ellipse, to get x^2/25 + 15*(x - 4)^2/9 = 1.

The numerator is zero when x is one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on up to 100.

        "answer": "Recall that the logarithm of a fraction can be rewritten as the logarithm of the numerator minus the logarithm of the denominator.

Most of the intermediate terms cancel out, and the expression eventually evaluates to the logarithm of 2010. Note that 2 to the power of 10 is 1024, but 2 to the power of 11 is 2048, so the logarithm of 2010 is between 10 and 11. It follows that the largest integer less than the sum is 10.

Therefore, we have the equation 2 times the square root of 300 plus k, equals the square root of 36 plus k, plus the square root of 596 plus k. \n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get 4 times 300 plus k, equals 36 plus k, plus 2 times the square root of the product of 36 plus k and 596 plus k, plus 596 plus k. \n\nThis simplifies to 568 plus 2k, equals 2 times the square root of the product of 36 plus k and 596 plus k. \n\nDividing by 2 and then squaring again, we have the square of 284 plus k, equals the product of 36 plus k and 596 plus k. \n\nThis simplifies to the square of 284, plus 2 times 284 times k, plus k squared, equals 36 times 596, plus 632 times k, plus k squared. \n\nThus, we have 284 squared, minus 36 times 596, equals 632 times k, minus 2 times 284 times k. \n\nSolving for k, we have k equals 284 squared, minus 36 times 596, divided by 632 minus 2 times 284. \n\nThis simplifies to k equals 284 squared, minus 36 times 596, divided by 64. \n\nThe answer is 925."

        "answer": "Let's start by defining the terms. We are given a sequence with the first term denoted as \"a\". Then, the sum of the first n terms, denoted as Sn, can be calculated using the formula: Sn = n * (2a + (n - 1) * 3) / 2.\n\nSimilarly, the sum of the first 3n terms, denoted as S3n, can be calculated using the formula: S3n = 3n * (2a + (3n - 1) * 3) / 2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratio of S3n to Sn. This can be done by dividing the formula for S3n by the formula for Sn. \n\nS3n / Sn = (3n * (2a + (3n - 1) * 3) / 2) / (n * (2a + (n - 1) * 3) / 2).\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get: S3n / Sn = 3 * (2a + 9n - 3) / (2a + 3n - 3).\n\nSince the ratio of S3n to Sn is a constant, let's denote it as \"c\". Then, we can write the equation as: (6a + 27n - 9) / (2a + 3n - 3) = c.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator, we get: 6a + 27n - 9 = 2ac + 3cn - 3c.\n\nNow, since this equation is true for all values of n, the coefficients of n on both sides must be equal. Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of n: 27 = 3c.\n\nSolving for c, we find: c = 9.\n\nSubstituting c = 9 back into the equation 6a + 27n - 9 = 2ac + 3cn - 3c, we get: 6a + 27n - 9 = 2a * 9 + 3n * 9 - 3 * 9.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: 6a + 27n - 9 = 18a + 27n - 27.\n\nNow, let's solve for a. We can start by subtracting 27n from both sides of the equation: 6a - 9 = 18a - 27.\n\nThen, we can add 9 to both sides: 6a = 18a - 18.\n\nSubtracting 18a from both sides, we get: -12a = -18.\n\nFinally, dividing both sides by -12, we find: a = 18 / 12 = 3 / 2.\n\nTherefore, the value of a is 3/2."

If x is an integer, then the floor of x equals the ceiling of x equals x, and so we get the equation 7x plus 2x equals c, so x equals c divided by 9. Since x is an integer in this case, this solution is valid if and only if c is a multiple of 9.\n\nIf x is not an integer, then the ceiling of x equals the floor of x plus 1, so we get the equation 7 times the floor of x plus 2 times the floor of x plus 1 equals c, so the floor of x equals c minus 2 divided by 9. Since the floor of x must be an integer, this produces valid solutions for x if and only if c minus 2 is a multiple of 9.\n\nPutting everything together, we see that in the interval from 0 to 1000, there are 112 multiples of 9 and 111 integers which are 2 more than a multiple of 9, for a total of 112 plus 111 equals 223 possible values of c."

We can rewrite this as (a + b)(a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - 3ab), which equals (a + b)((a + b)^2 - 3ab). Substituting the values of a + b and ab, we get 4 * (4^2 - 3 * 5) = 4.\n\nNext, to find the value of a^4b^2 + a^2b^4, we factor out a^2b^2 to get a^2b^2(a^2 + b^2).

Then we have t^2 = (x/y + y/x)^2 = x^2/y^2 + 2 + y^2/x^2, so t^2 - 2 = x^2/y^2 + y^2/x^2, and the equation becomes 3 = k^2(t^2 - 2) + kt. Rearranging, we have the quadratic 0 = k^2t^2 + kt - (2k^2 + 3). By the quadratic formula, t = (-k \u00b1 sqrt(k^2 + 4k^2(2k^2 + 3)))/2k^2 = (-1 \u00b1 sqrt(8k^2 + 13))/2k. Since x and y are positive, t is also positive, and furthermore, t = x/y + y/x \u2265 2*sqrt(x/y * y/x) = 2 by AM-GM. Therefore, the above equation must have a root in the interval [2, infinity). It follows that (-1 + sqrt(8k^2 + 13))/2k \u2265 2. Multiplying both sides by 2k and adding 1, we get sqrt(8k^2 + 13) \u2265 4k + 1. Then 8k^2 + 13 \u2265 (4k + 1)^2 = 16k^2 + 8k + 1, so 0 \u2265 8k^2 + 8k - 12. By the quadratic formula, the roots of 8k^2 + 8k - 12 = 0 are k = (-8 \u00b1 sqrt(8^2 + 4*8*12))/2*8 = (-1 \u00b1 sqrt(7))/2, so (-1 - sqrt(7))/2 \u2264 k \u2264 (-1 + sqrt(7))/2, and the maximum value of k is -1 + sqrt(7)/2.\n\nThe final answer is: -1 + sqrt(7)/2"

Then, the product of omega and its conjugate is equal to the square of the absolute value of omega, which is 1.\n\nAlso, omega cubed minus 1 is equal to 0, which can be factored as the product of omega minus 1 and omega squared plus omega plus 1, which is equal to 0. Since omega is not equal to 1, omega squared plus omega plus 1 is equal to 0.\n\nHence, the square of the absolute value of the expression a plus b times omega plus c times omega squared is equal to the product of the expression a plus b times omega plus c times omega squared and its conjugate.

This means M is less than or equal to one half. On the other hand, by the triangle inequality, c is less than a plus b, so c squared is less than the quantity a plus b, all squared, which equals a squared plus 2ab plus b squared. By the AM-GM inequality, 2ab is less than a squared plus b squared, so c squared is less than 2a squared plus 2b squared.

        "answer": "Expanding the given expression, we get the result in the form of two equations. Since a and b are integers, we can solve for a and b using these equations. \n\nFrom the second equation, we can factor it as b times the sum of 3a and b squared equals 37. As 37 is a prime number, we have two possible values for b, which are 37 and 1. \n\nIf we take b as 37, then 3a plus b squared equals 1, which doesn't give any positive integer solutions for a. Therefore, the value of b must be 1. \n\nSubstituting b as 1 in the equation, we get 3a plus b squared equals 37, which results in a equals 12. \n\nNow, let's verify if the values of a and b satisfy the first equation. Substituting the values of a and b, we get the left side of the equation as a plus 3b squared times the square root of a, which equals 12 plus 3 times 1 squared times the square root of 12. This simplifies to 15 times the square root of 12, which equals the square root of 2700. \n\nSo, the values of a and b are 12 and 1, respectively, and a plus b equals 12 plus 1, which equals 13. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"

Then, log base 4 of 27 is equal to 3 times log base 4 of 3, which is equal to 3t, and log base 2 of 9 is equal to log base 4 of 9 divided by log base 4 of 2, which is equal to 2 times log base 4 of 3 divided by 1/2, which is equal to 4t. Therefore, the triangle has its sides in the proportion 3:4:5, so h is equal to 5t, which is equal to 5 times log base 4 of 3, which is equal to log base 4 of 243. Thus, 4 raised to the power of h is equal to 243."

        "answer": "We start with the first equation. Any value of x that makes the first equation true must also satisfy the equation (x + a)(x + b)(x + 12) = 0. Therefore, the only possible roots of the first equation are -a, -b, and -12. Because the first equation has three distinct roots, it must be that -a, -b, and -12 are all distinct and all satisfy the first equation. This means that -a, -b, and -12 cannot equal -3, since when x = -3 in the first equation, the denominator of the fraction becomes zero. In conclusion, from the first equation having 3 distinct roots, we discern that all of the numbers -a, -b, -12, and -3 are distinct. That is, all the numbers a, b, 3, and 12 are distinct.\n\nThen -3 is necessarily a root of the second equation, because when x = -3, the numerator is zero, while the denominator is nonzero. Thus, -3 must be the only root of the second equation. In particular, neither -2a nor -6 can be another distinct root of the equation, even though they are roots of the numerator.\n\nSince -6 is not equal to -3, it must be that -6 is not a root of the second equation at all, because it makes the denominator zero. Then we must have -6 + b = 0, so b = 6.\n\nFor -2a not to be another distinct root, we must either have -2a = -3 (so that -2a is a root of the second equation, but it is equal to the other root, -3), or x = -2a must make the denominator zero. The denominator is (x + 6)(x + 12) = 0, so either -2a + 6 = 0 or -2a + 12 = 0, which means either a = 3 or a = 6. But we know that a, b, 3, and 12 are distinct, and b = 6, so this is impossible. Hence -2a = -3, so a = 3/2.\n\nIn conclusion, the two equations are given by the roots of the first and second equations, and they satisfy the conditions: the first equation has roots x = -3/2, -6, -12, while the second equation has only the one root x = -3. Hence, 100a + b = 100 * (3/2) + 6 = 156. \n\nThe final answer is 156."

Otherwise, y is not equal to 0, so we can divide both sides by y: \n1/(y^2 - 49) + 1/(y^2 - 25) - 1/(y^2 - 9) - 1/(y^2 - 1) = 0.\nNow, let z = y^2, so we have: \n1/(z - 49) + 1/(z - 25) - 1/(z - 9) - 1/(z - 1) = 0.\nThen we can rewrite the equation as: \n1/(z - 49) - 1/(z - 9) = 1/(z - 1) - 1/(z - 25).\nCombining the fractions on each side, we get: \n40/((z - 49)(z - 9)) = -24/((z - 1)(z - 25)).\nHence, 40(z - 1)(z - 25) = -24(z - 49)(z - 9). This simplifies to z^2 - 38z + 181 = 0. \nBy the quadratic formula, z = 19 \u00b1 6 sqrt(5). \nThen y = \u00b1 sqrt(19 \u00b1 6 sqrt(5)), and x = -7 \u00b1 sqrt(19 \u00b1 6 sqrt(5)). \nThus, a + b + c + d = 7 + 19 + 6 + 5 = 37. \n\nThe final answer is: 37"

If we make the substitution y equals x to the power of 2, our expression becomes y to the power of 3 minus 3 times y to the power of 2 plus 3 times y minus 1, which equals y minus 1, to the power of 3. \n\nNow, we substitute x to the power of 2 back in for y, so y minus 1, to the power of 3, equals x to the power of 2 minus 1, to the power of 3.

The roots of this equation will form a parallelogram centered at the origin, which means they are of the form w1, -w1, w2, -w2. Thus, we can also write the equation as (w - w1)(w + w1)(w - w2)(w + w2) = (w^2 - w1^2)(w^2 - w2^2) = 0.\n\nSince the coefficient of w will be 0, we have -96a^2 + 384a - 288 = 0. This equation factors as -96(a - 1)(a - 3) = 0, so a = 1 or a = 3.\n\nFor a = 1, the equation becomes 16w^4 - 40w^2 + 25 = (4w^2 - 5)^2 = 0, which has two double roots.\n\nFor a = 3, the given equation becomes w^4 + 312w^2 - 767 = 0. The roots of x^2 + 312x - 767 = 0 are real, and one is positive and the other is negative.

Find the unique number that is not in the range of f.",
        "answer": "The equation f(f(x)) = x can be written out as f(ax+b/cx+d) = x, which implies that (a * (ax+b/cx+d) + b) / (c * (ax+b/cx+d) + d) = x. This further implies that (a*(ax+b) + b*(cx+d)) / (c*(ax+b) + d*(cx+d)) = x, which simplifies to (a^2+bc)*x + (ab+bd) = (ac+cd)*x^2 + (bc+d^2)*x.\n\nSince this equation holds for many distinct values of x, the corresponding coefficients must be equal. This gives us three equations: ab+bd = 0, a^2+bc = bc+d^2, and ac+cd = 0. Since b and c are nonzero, the first and last equations simplify to a+d = 0, so d = -a, and the second equation is automatically satisfied.\n\nNow, using f(19) = 19 and f(97) = 97, we get two equations: 19 = (19a+b) / (19c-a) and 97 = (97a+b) / (97c-a). These can be rewritten as b = 19^2 * c - 2*19*a and b = 97^2 * c - 2*97*a. \n\nTo find the unique number not in the range of f, we look for an expression for the inverse of f. We find that the inverse of f is given by f inverse(x) = (dx-b) / (a-cx). Since x = a/c is not in the domain of the inverse of f, it is also not in the range of f.\n\nWe now solve for a/c. We have 19^2 * c - 2*19*a = 97^2 * c - 2*97*a, so 2*(97-19)*a = (97^2 - 19^2)*c. Thus a/c = (97^2 - 19^2) / (2*(97-19)), which simplifies to (97+19)/2 = 58.\n\nSo, the answer is 58."

        "answer": "The problem gives us the equations w = a - 1, x = b - 1, y = c - 1, and z = d - 1. Then, we can express a, b, c, and d in terms of w, x, y, and z as a = w + 1, b = x + 1, c = y + 1, and d = z + 1. \n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation a + b + c + d = 6, we get w + x + y + z + 4 = 6, which simplifies to w + x + y + z = 2.\n\nWe are also given that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 12. Substituting the expressions for a, b, c, and d in terms of w, x, y, and z, we get (w + 1)^2 + (x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + (z + 1)^2 = 12. \n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(w + x + y + z) + 4 = 12. Since we know that w + x + y + z = 2, we can substitute this into the equation to get w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(2) + 4 = 12. This simplifies to w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of 4(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4). We start by expressing a, b, c, and d in terms of w, x, y, and z. Then, we can rewrite the expression as the sum of (4a^3 - a^4) for a, b, c, and d.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for a, b, c, and d in terms of w, x, y, and z, we get the sum of (w + 1)^3(3 - w) for w, x, y, and z. Expanding and simplifying, we get the sum of (-w^4 + 6w^2 + 8w + 3) for w, x, y, and z.\n\nCombining like terms, we get -(w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4) + 6(w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 8(w + x + y + z) + 12. We know that w + x + y + z = 2 and w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4. Substituting these values into the equation, we get -(w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4) + 6(4) + 8(2) + 12 = 52 - (w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4).\n\nWe can find the range of possible values for w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4. First, we know that (w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 = 16. Expanding this, we get w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + 2(w^2x^2 + w^2y^2 + x^2y^2 + w^2z^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2) = 16.\n\nSince the terms w^2x^2, w^2y^2, x^2y^2, w^2z^2, x^2z^2, and y^2z^2 are all non-negative, the minimum possible value of w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4 is 16 - 2(maximum possible value of w^2x^2 + w^2y^2 + x^2y^2 + w^2z^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2), which occurs when w = 2 and x = y = z = 0.\n\nUsing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we get 4(w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4) >= (w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2. Since w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4, we have 4(w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4) >= 16. \n\nThis gives us w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4 >= 4. The minimum possible value of w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4 is 4, which occurs when w = -1 and x = y = z = 1.\n\nNow, we can find the range of possible values for 4(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4). We know that 52 - (w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4) = 4(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4). Since 4 <= w^4 + x^4 + y^4 + z^4 <= 16, we have 36 <= 4(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) <= 48.\n\nThe minimum value occurs when (a, b, c, d) = (1, 1, 1, 3) and the maximum value occurs when (a, b, c, d) = (0, 2, 2, 2). Therefore, the sum of the minimum and maximum values is 36 + 48 = 84. The answer is 84."

        "answer": "The problem can be solved by letting s equal x plus y and p equal x times y. Then the first equation reads s plus p equals 71, and the second equation reads x squared times y plus x times y squared equals x plus y times x times y equals s times p equals 880. Therefore, s and p are the roots of t squared minus 71t plus 880 equals 0. This factors as t minus 16 times t minus 55 equals 0, so s and p are the numbers 16 and 55 in some order. If s equals 16 and p equals 55, then x squared plus y squared equals x plus y squared minus 2 times x times y equals s squared minus 2 times p equals 16 squared minus 2 times 55 equals 146. If s equals 55 and p equals 16, then from x plus y equals 55, we see that p equals x times y is greater than or equal to 1 times 54 equals 54, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the answer is 146."

        "answer": "The sum of the odd-numbered terms in the sequence is equal to S. The sum of all the terms is 5307. By pairing up the terms, we find that the sum of the even-numbered terms is S + 1005. Since the sum of all the terms is the sum of the odd-numbered terms plus the sum of the even-numbered terms, we can write the equation S + (S + 1005) = 5307.

        "answer": "Solving for a, we find that a is equal to the negative of the expression (x to the power of 4 minus x squared plus 1) divided by (x cubed plus x). This can also be expressed as the negative of the expression (x squared minus 1 plus 1 divided by x squared) divided by (x plus 1 divided by x). \n\nLet u be equal to x plus 1 divided by x. Then u squared is equal to x squared plus 2 plus 1 divided by x squared. Therefore, a is equal to the negative of the expression (u squared minus 3) divided by u.\n\nIf x is positive, then by the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, u is greater than or equal to 2. Also, a plus 1 divided by 2 is less than or equal to 0, so a is less than or equal to -1 divided by 2.\n\nFurthermore, if u is between 2 and v, then the expression -v squared plus 3 divided by v plus u squared minus 3 divided by u is less than or equal to 0. This means that the expression -u squared plus 3 divided by u is decreasing on the interval from 2 to infinity. As u approaches infinity, the expression -u plus 3 divided by u approaches negative infinity.\n\nNote that u can take on any value greater than or equal to 2. Similarly, we can show that if x is negative, then a is greater than or equal to 1 divided by 2, and a can take on all values greater than or equal to 1 divided by 2.\n\nHence, the possible values of a are all real numbers less than or equal to -1 divided by 2, or all real numbers greater than or equal to 1 divided by 2.

We know that the sum of any three consecutive terms is 30 and that C is 5, so A plus B plus C is equal to A plus B plus 5, which equals 30, and thus A plus B equals 25. Now, we have the sum of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, which is equal to A plus the sum of B, C, and D, plus the sum of E, F, and G, plus H, which is equal to A plus 30 plus 30 plus H, which is A plus H plus 60. \n\nWe also have the sum of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, which is equal to the sum of A and B, plus the sum of C, D, and E, plus the sum of F, G, and H, which is equal to 25 plus 30 plus 30, which equals 85. \n\nEquating the two values we obtained for the sum, we find that A plus H plus 60 equals 85, so A plus H equals 25. \n\nThe answer is 25."

Using the equation x^2 - xy + 2y^2, we get u * (1 - k) = 8, and x^2 + xy + 2y^2 = u * (1 + k) = 8 * (1 + k) / (1 - k). \n\nThis is an increasing function of k for k < 1, so it is maximized at k = 1 / (2 * sqrt(2)). Hence, the maximum value of x^2 + xy + 2y^2 is 8 * (1 + 1 / (2 * sqrt(2))) / (1 - 1 / (2 * sqrt(2))), which simplifies to (72 + 32 * sqrt(2)) / 7. \n\nThe final answer is 113."

Since 1 <= 2001/3^6 <= 3, we can apply the definition of f to get f(2001) = 3^6(1 - |2001/3^6 - 2|) = 3 * 3^6 - 2001 = 186. \n\nWe want the smallest x for which f(x) = 186. Note that the range of f(x) in the interval x = [1, 3] is [0, 1]. Since f(3x) = 3f(x) for all x, it follows that the range of f(x) in the interval x = [3, 9] is [0, 3]. Similarly, for each k, the range of f(x) in the interval x = [3^k, 3^(k+1)] is [0, 3^k]. \n\nTherefore, if f(x) = 186, then 3^k >= 186, so k >= 5. We search the interval x = [3^5, 3^6] = [243, 729]. We want f(x) = 186, and for any x in this interval, we have f(x) = 3^5f(x/3^5). Letting y = x/3^5, we want f(y) = 186/3^5 = 186/243, where y = [1, 3]. \n\nThat is, 1 - |y-2| = 186/243, which implies |y-2| = 57/243. The smaller of the two solutions to this equation is y = 2 - 57/243 = 429/243. Thus, x = 3^5y = 429. \n\nThe answer is 429."

Since d is positive, d = 2.\n\nLet P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. Then P(P(x)) = a(ax^2 + bx + c)^2 + b(ax^2 + bx + c) + c, and (x^2 + x + 1)(ax^2 + bx + c) = ax^4 + (a + b) x^3 + (a + b + c) x^2 + (b + c) x + c.\n\nComparing coefficients, we get a^3 = a, 2a^2 b = a + b, ab^2 + 2a^2 c + ab = a + b + c, 2abc + b^2 = b + c, and ac^2 + bc + c = c.\n\nFrom a^3 = a, we get a(a - 1)(a + 1) = 0, so a is 0, 1, or -1.

        "answer": "We can write the given equation as follows: \nx to the power of 8 minus 98x to the power of 4 plus 1 = x to the power of 8 plus 2x to the power of 4 plus 1 minus 100x to the power of 4. \nThis can be simplified to x to the power of 8 plus 2x to the power of 4 plus 1 minus 100x to the power of 4 = x to the power of 4 plus 1 squared minus 10x squared squared. \nFurther simplifying, we get x to the power of 4 plus 1 squared minus 10x squared squared = x to the power of 4 plus 10x squared plus 1 times x to the power of 4 minus 10x squared plus 1. \nSetting x = 1 in each factor, we get 1 plus 10 plus 1 times 1 minus 10 plus 1, which simplifies to 12 times -8. However, considering the factors, we actually add them, resulting in 12 + -8, but since the second term is negative and in the factor form they were being multiplied, so it's actually (1 + 10 + 1) + (1 - 10 + 1) = 12 + (-8) which can also be looked at as (1 + 10 + 1) + (1 - 10 + 1), which is actually 12 - 8, but after going through the calculation, the numbers are (1 + 10 + 1) = 12 and (1 - 10 + 1) = -8, however adding them as the problem requests gives us (12) + (-8), the numbers are actually being added, however in this special case the numbers were 12 and -8 and 12 - 8 = 4 which actually results in the final answer being 4. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"

        "answer": "We take cases based on the sign of sixty minus two x. If sixty minus two x is greater than or equal to zero, then the equation becomes x equals the absolute value of two x minus sixty plus two x, which simplifies to x equals the absolute value of four x minus sixty. Therefore, either x equals four x minus sixty, which gives x equals twenty, or x equals negative four x plus sixty, which gives x equals twelve. Both solutions satisfy sixty minus two x is greater than or equal to zero, so they are valid.\n\nIf sixty minus two x is less than zero, then the equation becomes x equals the absolute value of two x plus sixty minus two x, which simplifies to x equals sixty. This solution satisfies sixty minus two x is less than zero, so x equals sixty is the only solution in this case.\n\nThe sum of all the solutions is therefore twelve plus twenty plus sixty, which equals ninety-two."

Thus, the center of the circle is at the point (6, 0) and its radius is sqrt(5). \n\nNote that the parabola y^2 = 4x opens to the right. Let 2t be the y-coordinate of point B. Then x = y^2 / 4 = (2t)^2 / 4 = t^2, so B = (t^2, 2t).\n\nLet C = (6, 0) be the center of the circle. By the Triangle Inequality, AB + AC >= BC, so AB >= BC - AC. Since A is a point on the circle, AC = sqrt(5), so AB >= BC - sqrt(5). \n\nTo minimize BC, we have BC^2 = (t^2 - 6)^2 + (2t)^2 = t^4 - 12t^2 + 36 + 4t^2 = t^4 - 8t^2 + 36 = (t^2 - 4)^2 + 20 >= 20, so BC >= sqrt(20) = 2 sqrt(5).

We start by solving the equation 25a + 12c = 1950, where a is the number of adults and c is the number of children. \n\nThis can be rearranged to a = 78 - (12c / 25). Since a must be an integer, c must be a multiple of 25. The ratio we want is a/c, which can be rewritten as 78/c - 12/25. If a/c = 1, then 78/c - 12/25 = 1, which means 78/c = 37/25. Solving for c gives c = (78 * 25) / 37, which is approximately 52.7. \n\nThe multiple of 25 closest to this is 50. If c = 50, then a = 78 - (12 * 50 / 25) = 54.

We can calculate the first few values of S_n and observe the pattern. \n\nThe first few values of S_n are: \n- S_1 = -3\n- S_2 = 1/2\n- S_3 = -5/3\n- S_4 = -19/24\n- S_5 = -21/20\n- S_6 = -713/720\n\nFrom these values, we notice two things: \n- The denominators seem to be factors of n!, where n! denotes the factorial of n.\n- The fractions seem to be getting close to -1.\n\nSo, we rewrite each sum in the form (* / n!) - 1, where * is a number. \n- S_1 = (-2 / 1!) - 1\n- S_2 = (3 / 2!) - 1\n- S_3 = (-4 / 3!) - 1\n- S_4 = (5 / 4!) - 1\n- S_5 = (-6 / 5!) - 1\n- S_6 = (7 / 6!) - 1\n\nNow, the pattern becomes clear: \nS_n = ((-1)^n * (n + 1)) / n! - 1\n\nTo verify this formula, we set T_n = ((-1)^n * (n + 1)) / n! - 1 and calculate the difference T_k - T_(k - 1). \n\nT_k - T_(k - 1) = ((-1)^k * (k + 1)) / k! - 1 - ((-1)^(k - 1) * k) / (k - 1)! + 1\n= ((-1)^k * (k + 1)) / k! + ((-1)^k * k) / (k - 1)!\n= ((-1)^k * (k + 1)) / k! + ((-1)^k * k^2) / k!\n= ((-1)^k * (k^2 + k + 1)) / k!\n\nThus, the sum telescopes, and we verify the formula S_n = ((-1)^n * (n + 1)) / n! - 1.\n\nIn particular, S_100 = (101 / 100!) - 1.\n\nThen a = 101, b = 100, and c = 1, so a + b + c = 202. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{202}$"

        "answer": "We can represent the sum as the sum of n times 1988 minus n, from n equals 1 to 1987. This is equal to the sum of 1988n minus n squared, from n equals 1 to 1987, which equals 1988 times the sum of n from 1 to 1987, minus the sum of n squared from 1 to 1987.\n\nBy using the formulas for the sum of the first n natural numbers and the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers, we get 1988 times 1987 times 1988 divided by 2, minus 1987 times 1988 times 3975 divided by 6.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get 1987 times 1988 times 3 times 1988 minus 3975, all divided by 6. Further simplification yields 1987 times 2 times 994 times 1989, all divided by 6, which is equal to 1987 times 994 times 663 divided by 3.\n\nThus, the value of x is 663."

        "question": "Let a, b, and c be nonnegative real numbers such that a plus b plus c equals 1. Find the maximum value of the expression a plus the square root of ab plus the cube root of abc.",
        "answer": "Our strategy is to add a number of inequalities so that when we add them up, we get an inequality of the form t(a + b + c) \u2265 a + \u221a(ab) + \u221b(abc). To do so, we will use some variables to make sure we use the most general forms of AM-GM.\n\nIf we apply AM-GM to two terms, one of which is pb, then to obtain \u221a(ab) on the right-hand side, the other term must be (1/4p)a, as in (1/4p)a + pb \u2265 2\u221a((1/4p)a * pb) = \u221a(ab). Note that equality holds when (1/4p)a = pb, or a/b = 4p^2.\n\nWe then want an inequality of the form xa + yb + zc \u2265 \u221b(abc), where x, y, and z are coefficients that we want to fill in. We want equality to hold here for the same values of a and b as in the previous equation. This means we want xa = yb, or x/y = b/a = 1/(4p^2). So, let x = 1/(4pk) and y = p/k.\n\nFinally, z should be 4k^2/27, so that we obtain \u221b(abc) on the right-hand side. Thus, we have the inequalities a \u2265 a, (1/4p)a + pb \u2265 \u221a(ab), and (1/4pk)a + (p/k)b + (4k^2/27)c \u2265 \u221b(abc).\n\nWhen we add these up, we want the coefficients of a, b, and c to be equal. Thus, 1 + 1/(4p) + 1/(4pk) = p + p/k = 4k^2/27. Isolating p in p + p/k = 4k^2/27, we find p = 4k^3/(27(k + 1)).\n\nThen, 1 + 1/(4p) + 1/(4pk) = (4pk + k + 1)/(4pk) = 4k^2/27. Cross-multiplying, we get 27(4pk + k + 1) = 16pk^3. Substituting p = 4k^3/(27(k + 1)), we get 27(4k * 4k^3/(27(k + 1)) + k + 1) = 16k^3 * 4k^3/(27(k + 1)).\n\nThis simplifies to 64k^6 - 432k^4 - 729k^2 - 1458k - 729 = 0. Fortunately, this polynomial has k = 3 as a root. Then p = 1, and we get (4/3)a + (4/3)b + (4/3)c \u2265 a + \u221a(ab) + \u221b(abc).\n\nTherefore, a + \u221a(ab) + \u221b(abc) \u2264 4/3. Equality occurs when a = 16/21, b = 4/21, and c = 1/21, so the maximum value is 4/3. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4/3}$"

This function has the property that for each complex number z, f(z) is equidistant from both z and the origin. Given that the absolute value of a + bi is 8, find the value of b squared.",
        "answer": "From the given property, we have the equation |f(z) - z| = |f(z)|. Then, we can rewrite this as |(a + bi)z - z| = |(a + bi)z|, which simplifies to |a + bi - 1||z| = |a + bi||z|. Since this equation holds for all complex numbers z, we can conclude that |a + bi - 1| = |a + bi| = 8.\n\nNow, we can express |a + bi - 1| and |a + bi| in terms of a and b. We have |a + bi - 1| = sqrt((a - 1)^2 + b^2) and |a + bi| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Since both of these are equal to 8, we can write the equations (a - 1)^2 + b^2 = 64 and a^2 + b^2 = 64.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get (a - 1)^2 - a^2 = 0, which simplifies to -2a + 1 = 0. Solving for a, we find that a = 1/2.\n\nNow that we have the value of a, we can substitute it into one of the earlier equations to solve for b. Using the equation a^2 + b^2 = 64, we have (1/2)^2 + b^2 = 64, which simplifies to 1/4 + b^2 = 64. Subtracting 1/4 from both sides, we get b^2 = 64 - 1/4 = 255/4. \n\nThe final answer is: 255/4"

        "question": "The graph of y squared plus 2xy plus 40 times the absolute value of x equals 400 partitions the plane into several regions, what is the area of the bounded region?",
        "answer": "To deal with the absolute value term, we consider two cases based on the sign of x.\n\nIf x is greater than or equal to 0, we have the equation y^2 + 2xy + 40x = 400. By isolating x, we get x(2y + 40) = 400 - y^2, which can be factored as 2x(y + 20) = (20 - y)(y + 20). This gives us two possible solutions: y = -20 or 2x = 20 - y, which is equivalent to y = 20 - 2x.\n\nIf x is less than 0, we have the equation y^2 + 2xy - 40x = 400. Again, by isolating x, we get x(2y - 40) = 400 - y^2, which can be factored as 2x(y - 20) = (20 - y)(y + 20). This gives us two possible solutions: y = 20 or 2x = -y - 20, which is equivalent to y = -20 - 2x.\n\nBy combining these four equations, we find that the bounded region is a parallelogram with vertices at (0, 20), (0, -20), (20, -20), and (-20, 20). The height of the parallelogram is 40 and the base is 20, so the area of the parallelogram is 40 * 20 = 800. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{800}$"

Find the product of the number of possible values of f(2) and the sum of all possible values of f(2).",
        "answer": "The given function is analyzed by setting y equal to 1, which results in the equation f(x) * f(1) = f(x) + 2005/x + 2005^2. Since f(1) cannot be 1, we can solve for f(x) and get f(x) = (2005/x + 2005^2) / (f(1) - 1). \n\nBy substituting x = 1 into the equation, we get f(1) = (2005 + 2005^2) / (f(1) - 1). This leads to the quadratic equation f(1)^2 - f(1) - 2005^2 - 2005 = 0, which can be factored as (f(1) - 2006)(f(1) + 2005) = 0. Therefore, f(1) is either 2006 or -2005.\n\nIf f(1) equals 2006, then f(x) = (2005/x + 2005^2) / 2005, which simplifies to 1/x + 2005. This function works as a valid solution.\n\nOn the other hand, if f(1) equals -2005, then f(x) = (2005/x + 2005^2) / -2006. However, this function does not work as a valid solution.\n\nAs a result, the correct function is f(x) = 1/x + 2005. The value of n is 1, and the value of s is 1/2 + 2005, which equals 4011/2. Therefore, the product of n and s is 4011/2."

        "answer": "We can write the given equation in a simplified form. The equation is equal to the difference between two fractions, which can be rewritten as the difference between the reciprocal of two harmonic numbers. Thus, the sum of the series can be expressed as the sum of the differences between the reciprocals of consecutive harmonic numbers.\n\nWhen we expand the sum, we notice that most terms cancel each other out, leaving only the first term. This is a classic example of a telescoping series, where all intermediate terms are eliminated, and only the first and last terms remain. However, in this case, since the harmonic numbers increase without bound as n approaches infinity, the last term tends to zero.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the series simplifies to the reciprocal of the first harmonic number, which is equal to 1. This result relies on the fact that the harmonic numbers increase without bound as n approaches infinity. To prove this, we can group the terms of the harmonic series in a way that shows that the sum exceeds any finite value.\n\nFor example, we can group the terms as follows: the first term is greater than or equal to one-half, the next two terms are greater than one-half, the next four terms are greater than one-half, and so on. This shows that the harmonic series is greater than the sum of an infinite number of one-half terms, which clearly increases without bound.\n\nHence, we can conclude that the sum of the given series is equal to 1. The fact that the harmonic numbers increase without bound is essential to this result, as it ensures that the last term of the telescoping series tends to zero, leaving only the first term."

Hence, n is odd, and t_(n-1) equals 87 divided by 19. Then t_(n-1) must have been generated from the rule of adding 1, which means n-1 is even. Furthermore, 87 divided by 19 equals 4 plus 11 divided by 19, so this rule must have been applied four times. Thus, n-1 is divisible by 16, and t_(n-1 divided by 16) equals 11 divided by 19. Since 11 divided by 19 is less than 1, this term must have been generated from the rule of taking the reciprocal, which means n-1 divided by 16 is odd. Thus, t_((n-17) divided by 16) equals 19 divided by 11. We can keep working backwards to produce the following terms: t_((n-17) divided by 32) equals 8 divided by 11, t_((n-49) divided by 32) equals 11 divided by 8, t_((n-49) divided by 64) equals 3 divided by 8, t_((n-113) divided by 64) equals 8 divided by 3, t_((n-113) divided by 256) equals 2 divided by 3, t_((n-369) divided by 256) equals 3 divided by 2, t_((n-369) divided by 512) equals 1 divided by 2, t_((n-881) divided by 512) equals 2, t_((n-881) divided by 1024) equals 1.

        "question": "Find all the solutions to the equation: the cube root of 2 minus x, plus the square root of x minus 1, equals 1. Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.",
        "answer": "The given equation can be solved by letting y be equal to the cube root of 2 minus x. This gives us y cubed equals 2 minus x, which can be rearranged to x equals 2 minus y cubed. Substituting this into the original equation, we get the square root of x minus 1 equals the square root of 1 minus y cubed. Simplifying this, we get y plus the square root of 1 minus y cubed equals 1. Then, the square root of 1 minus y cubed equals 1 minus y. Squaring both sides of the equation, we get 1 minus y cubed equals 1 minus 2y plus y squared. Rearranging this equation, we get y cubed plus y squared minus 2y equals 0. Factoring this equation, we get y times y minus 1 times y plus 2 equals 0. This gives us three possible values for y: 0, 1, and minus 2. Substituting these values back into the equation x equals 2 minus y cubed, we get x equals 2 minus 0 cubed, x equals 2 minus 1 cubed, and x equals 2 minus minus 2 cubed. Solving these equations, we get x equals 2 minus 0, x equals 2 minus 1, and x equals 2 minus minus 8. This simplifies to x equals 2, x equals 1, and x equals 10. Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x equals 1, x equals 2, and x equals 10. Checking these solutions, we can confirm that they work. The final answers are 1, 2, and 10."

Because the floor of x is an integer, and the fractional part of y is between 0 and 1, the only possibility is that the floor of x is 2 and the fractional part of y is 0.4.

The sign table for these components is as follows:\n\n- For x less than 0, all components are negative, resulting in f(x) being negative.\n- For x between 0 and 3, 2x-7 and x-3 are negative, while x is positive, making f(x) positive.\n- For x between 3 and 7/2, 2x-7 is negative, while x-3 and x are positive, resulting in f(x) being negative.\n- For x greater than 7/2, all components are positive, resulting in f(x) being positive.\n\nIt follows that f(x) is greater than zero when 0 is less than x and x is less than 3, or when x is greater than 7/2. Since the inequality is nonstrict, the values of x for which f(x) equals zero must be included, which are x equals 3 and x equals 7/2.\n\nThus, the solution set is the set of x such that x is in the interval (0, 3] or the interval [7/2, infinity)."

        "answer": "The largest difference must be w - z = 9. The two differences w - x and x - z must add up to w - z = 9. Similarly, the two differences of w - y and y - z must add up to 9. Thus, the sets of w - x, x - z and w - y, y - z must be 3, 6 and 4, 5 in some order. This leaves x - y = 1.\n\nIn the first case, if the sets of w - x, x - z and w - y, y - z are 3, 6 and 4, 5 respectively, then w - x = 3, so x - z = 6. Since x - y = 1, y - z = 5. Therefore, z = w - 9, x = w - 3, and y = w - 4. Given that w + x + y + z = 44, we can solve for w and get w = 15.\n\nIn the second case, if the sets of w - x, x - z and w - y, y - z are 4, 5 and 3, 6 respectively, then y - z = 3, so w - y = 6. Since x - y = 1, w - x = 5. Therefore, z = w - 9, x = w - 5, and y = w - 6. Given that w + x + y + z = 44, we can solve for w and get w = 16.\n\nThe sum of all possible values of w is then 15 + 16 = 31."

        "answer": "The sum S is defined as the sum of the function g applied to the numbers 1 through 20. By definition of a tenuous function, we can rearrange the terms in S to get a sum of pairs of g values, where the first term in each pair is a g value for a number from 20 down to 11, and the second term is a g value for a number from 1 up to 10.\n\nWe find that S is greater than or equal to the sum of the squares of the numbers 20 through 11, plus 1. This gives us a lower bound for S of 2495. We then assume that S equals this lower bound, and use the definition of tenuous to derive a system of equations for the g values.\n\nFrom the system of equations, we find that the g values for the numbers 1 through 10 must all be equal, which we denote as a. We also find that the g value for any number n greater than or equal to 11 is given by n squared plus 1 minus a.\n\nUsing the definition of tenuous again, we can find a lower bound for g of 11, which is 61. This means that a must be less than or equal to 61. We then find the smallest possible value for g of 14, which is 196 plus 1 minus a. The smallest possible value of g of 14 is obtained when a is as large as possible, which is 61.\n\nSo the smallest possible value of g of 14 is 196 plus 1 minus 61, which equals 136.

If 1 is less than or equal to x and x is less than y, then we can calculate g(y) - g(x) to determine if the function is increasing.\n\nWe start by calculating g(y) - g(x) = y + 1/y - x - 1/x. Simplifying this, we get y - x + 1/y - 1/x. Further simplification gives us y - x + (x - y)/xy, which equals (y - x)(1 - 1/xy) or (y - x)(xy - 1)/xy.\n\nSince y is greater than x and x is greater than or equal to 1, xy is greater than 1, so (y - x)(xy - 1)/xy is greater than 0. This means that g(x) is increasing on the interval from 1 to infinity.\n\nUsing the AM-GM inequality and the fact that g(x) is increasing, we get x + 1/x is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, g(x + 1/x) is greater than or equal to 2 + 1/2, which equals 5/2.\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) occurs when x equals 1, so the minimum value of f(x) for x greater than 0 is 5/2.\n\nNote that we cannot use the following argument: By AM-GM, x + 1/x + 1/(x + 1/x) is greater than or equal to 2 times the square root of (x + 1/x) times 1/(x + 1/x), which equals 2.

Since the parabola y = x^2 is symmetric about the y-axis, the focus is at a point of the form (0, f). Let y = d be the equation of the directrix.\n\nLet (x, x^2) be a point on the parabola y = x^2. Then the distance from this point to the focus F is given by the equation PF^2 = x^2 + (x^2 - f)^2, and the distance from this point to the directrix is given by PQ^2 = (x^2 - d)^2. Since these distances are equal, we can set up the equation x^2 + (x^2 - f)^2 = (x^2 - d)^2.\n\nExpanding this equation, we get x^2 + x^4 - 2fx^2 + f^2 = x^4 - 2dx^2 + d^2. By matching the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equation, we get two equations: 1 - 2f = -2d and f^2 = d^2.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can see that f - d = 1/2. Since f^2 = d^2, we know that f = d or f = -d. However, we cannot have f = d, because this would mean that f - d = 0, which contradicts the equation f - d = 1/2. Therefore, we must have f = -d.\n\nSubstituting f = -d into the equation f - d = 1/2, we get -d - d = 1/2, which simplifies to -2d = 1/2. Solving for d, we get d = -1/4. Since f = -d, we have f = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the focus of the parabola y = x^2 is at the point (0, 1/4). The answer is (0, 1/4)."

The equation f(x) = 12 has at most three roots, and the equation f(x) = -12 has at most three roots, so exactly three of the values are equal to 12, and the other three are equal to -12.\n\nFurthermore, let s be the sum of the x such that f(x) = 12. Then by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the x such that f(x) = -12 is also equal to s. The polynomials f(x) - 12 and f(x) + 12 only differ in the constant term. Hence, 2s = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 24, so s = 12.\n\nThe only ways to get three numbers from the set 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 to add up to 12 are 1 + 5 + 6 and 2 + 3 + 7. Without loss of generality, assume that f(1) = f(5) = f(6) = -12 and f(2) = f(3) = f(7) = 12.\n\nLet g(x) = f(x) + 12. Then g(x) is a cubic polynomial, and g(1) = g(5) = g(6) = 0, so g(x) = c(x - 1)(x - 5)(x - 6) for some constant c. Also, g(2) = 24, so 24 = c(2 - 1)(2 - 5)(2 - 6). This leads to c = 2. Then g(x) = 2(x - 1)(x - 5)(x - 6), so f(x) = 2(x - 1)(x - 5)(x - 6) - 12. In particular, the absolute value of f(0) is 72."

        "answer": "We have the factorization of x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz as (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz). By expanding (x - y)^2 + (x - z)^2 + (y - z)^2 = xyz, we get 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 - 2xy - 2xz - 2yz = xyz. This results in x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz = xyz/2. Substituting this back into the original factorization, we get x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(xyz/2), and since x + y + z = 20, we have x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 20 * xyz/2 = 10xyz.

However, we are given that p plus q equals sixty-three, which is an odd number. Therefore, one of p or q must be even, and the other must be odd, in order for their sum to be odd.\n\nGiven that one of the roots must be even, the smallest possible even root is two.

        "answer": "Let the three numbers be x, y, and z. Without loss of generality, assume that x is less than or equal to y, which is less than or equal to z. Then z is less than or equal to 2x.\n\nSuppose z is less than 2x. Let x1 be the average of x and z, and z1 be the average of 2x and 2z. Then z1 is equal to 2x1, and x1 plus z1 is equal to x plus z. We do not change the value of y. Note that the product xyz minus x1yz1 is greater than 0. This means that if z is less than 2x, and we replace x with x1 and z with z1, the value of the product xyz decreases.\n\nSo, to find the minimum of xyz, we can restrict our attention to triples (x, y, z) where z is equal to 2x. Our three numbers are then x, which is less than or equal to y, which is less than or equal to 2x. Since the three numbers add up to 1, 3x plus y is equal to 1, so y is equal to 1 minus 3x. Then x is less than or equal to 1 minus 3x, which is less than or equal to 2x. So, 1/5 is less than or equal to x, which is less than or equal to 1/4.\n\nWe want to minimize the product xyz, which is equal to x times (1 minus 3x) times 2x.

Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get 2t^4 + 48t^2 + 32 = 82, which further simplifies to t^4 + 24t^2 - 25 = 0. \n\nFactoring this equation, we get (t^2 - 1)(t^2 + 25) = 0. Solving for t, we find that t = 1 or t = -1. If t = 1, then a = 3, which leads to 47 - 2x = 3^4, giving x = -17. If t = -1, then a = 1, which leads to 47 - 2x = 1^4, giving x = 23.\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the given equations are x = 23 and x = -17. We can verify that these solutions satisfy the original equations."

Solving for a_(n-1) in b_n = (b_(n-1)^2)/a_(n-1), we find a_(n-1) = (b_(n-1)^2)/b_n. Then, a_n = (b_n^2)/b_(n+1). Substituting into the equation above, we get ((b_n^2)/b_(n-1)) * b_n = ((b_(n-1)^2)/b_(n+1)) * b_(n-1).

        "answer": "The function f1(x) = sqrt(1-x) is defined when x is less than or equal to 1. Next, we have f2(x) = f1(sqrt(4-x)) = sqrt(1-sqrt(4-x)). For this to be defined, we must have 4-x greater than or equal to 0, or x less than or equal to 4, and the number sqrt(4-x) must lie in the domain of f1, so sqrt(4-x) less than or equal to 1, or x greater than or equal to 3. Thus, the domain of f2 is the interval from 3 to 4.\n\nSimilarly, for f3(x) = f2(sqrt(9-x)) to be defined, we must have x less than or equal to 9, and the number sqrt(9-x) must lie in the interval from 3 to 4. Therefore, 3 is less than or equal to sqrt(9-x) which is less than or equal to 4. Squaring all parts of this inequality gives 9 less than or equal to 9-x which is less than or equal to 16, and so -7 less than or equal to x which is less than or equal to 0. Thus, the domain of f3 is the interval from -7 to 0.\n\nSimilarly, for f4(x) = f3(sqrt(16-x)) to be defined, we must have x less than or equal to 16, and sqrt(16-x) must lie in the interval from -7 to 0. But sqrt(16-x) is always nonnegative, so we must have sqrt(16-x) = 0, or x = 16. Thus, the domain of f4 consists of a single point, 16.\n\nWe see, then, that f5(x) = f4(sqrt(25-x)) is defined if and only if sqrt(25-x) = 16, or x = 25 - 16^2 = -231. Therefore, the domain of f5 is -231.\n\nThe domain of f6(x) is empty, because sqrt(36-x) can never equal a negative number like -231. Thus, the value of N is 5 and the value of c is -231."

Expanding this equation gives x^2 + 4x^4 + 4fx^2 + f^2 = 4x^4 + 4dx^2 + d^2.\n\nMatching coefficients, we get two equations: 1 + 4f = 4d and f^2 = d^2. From the first equation, d - f = 1/4. Since f^2 = d^2, f = d or f = -d. We cannot have f = d, so f = -d. Then 2d = 1/4, so d = 1/8.\n\nThus, the equation of the directrix of y = -2x^2 is y = 1/8. To find the equation of the directrix of y = -2(x - 1)^2 - 6, we need to shift the directrix of y = -2x^2 downward 6 units, which gives y = 1/8 - 6 = -47/8.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the directrix of the parabola y = -2(x - 1)^2 - 6 is y = -47/8."

Similarly, either j or j + 1 is even, so j(j + 1) is always even. Thus, 3k + j + (k + j)^2 is always even.\n\nWe claim that for any nonnegative integer n, there exist unique nonnegative integers j and k such that 3k + j + (k + j)^2 = 2n.\nLet a = k + j, so 3k + j + (k + j)^2 = 2k + (k + j) + (k + j)^2 = a^2 + a + 2k.\nFor a fixed value of a, k can range from 0 to a, so a^2 + a + 2k takes on all even integers from a^2 + a to a^2 + a + 2a = a^2 + 3a.\n\nFurthermore, for k + j = a + 1, \n3k + j + (k + j)^2 = (a + 1)^2 + (a + 1) + 2k = a^2 + 3a + 2 + 2k \ntakes on all even integers from a^2 + 3a + 2 to a^2 + 3a + 2 + 2(a + 1) = a^2 + 5a + 4, and so on. \nThus, for different values of a = k + j, the possible values of 3k + j + (k + j)^2 do not overlap, and it takes on all even integers exactly once.\n\nTherefore, \nthe sum of 2 to the power of negative 3k minus j minus (k + j)^2 for all j and k is equal to \nthe sum of 2 to the power of negative 2i for all i, which is equal to 4/3. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4/3}$"

        "answer": "The 200 numbers sum up to 10,000, so their average is 10,000 divided by 200, which equals 50.\n\nThen we can represent the sequence as a list of numbers starting from 50 minus 199 times a certain difference, and ending at 50 plus 199 times that same difference.\n\nSince all the terms are at least 10, the first and last term of the sequence must also be at least 10. This means 50 minus 199 times the absolute value of the difference must be greater than or equal to 10. \n\nThis gives us that the absolute value of the difference is less than or equal to 40 divided by 199. Therefore, the difference is at most 40 divided by 199 and at least negative 40 divided by 199.\n\nThe fiftieth term is 50 minus 101 times the difference. \n\nTo find the lower and upper bounds of the fiftieth term, we can plug in the maximum and minimum values of the difference. \n\nFor the lower bound, we get 50 minus 101 times 40 divided by 199.

The sum of the roots of q(x) is also 0, so the third root is -(r + 4) - (s - 3) = -r - s - 1 = t - 1. Also, a = (r + 4)(s - 3) + (r + 4)(t - 1) + (s - 3)(t - 1). Hence, rs + rt + st = (r + 4)(s - 3) + (r + 4)(t - 1) + (s - 3)(t - 1). This simplifies to t = 4r - 3s + 13.\n\nAlso, b = -rst and b + 240 = -(r + 4)(s - 3)(t - 1). Hence, -rst + 240 = (r + 4)(s - 3)(t - 1). Substituting t = 4r - 3s + 13, we get -rs(4r - 3s + 13) + 240 = -(r + 4)(s - 3)(4r - 3s + 12). This simplifies to r^2 - 2rs + s^2 + 7r - 7s - 8 = 0. Then (r - s)^2 + 7(r - s) - 8 = 0, which factors as (r - s - 1)(r - s + 8) = 0. Thus, r - s = 1 or r - s = -8.\n\nIf r - s = 1, then s = r - 1, and t = 4r - 3s + 13 = r + 16.

The problem states that x = 2 + i is a root of f(x). \n\nSince the coefficients of the function are symmetric, we have the relationship f(1/x) = f(x)/x^4 for all x not equal to 0. This means that if x = r is a root of f(x), then x = 1/r is also a root.\n\nIn particular, since x = 2 + i is a root, x = 1/(2 + i) is also a root. We can simplify this root by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. \n\nThis gives us x = (2 - i)/5 = 2/5 - i/5. Now we have two non-real roots of f(x). Since f(x) has real coefficients, the conjugates of its roots are also roots.\n\nTherefore, the four roots of f(x) are 2 + i, 2 - i, 2/5 + i/5, and 2/5 - i/5. We can use these roots to find the quadratic factors of f(x).\n\nThe monic quadratic whose roots are 2 + i and 2 - i is (x - 2 - i)(x - 2 + i) = x^2 - 4x + 5.\n\nThe monic quadratic whose roots are 2/5 + i/5 and 2/5 - i/5 is (x - 2/5 - i/5)(x - 2/5 + i/5) = x^2 - 4/5x + 1/5.\n\nWe can now use these quadratic factors to express f(x) as a product of two quadratics. \n\nf(x) = a(x^2 - 4x + 5)(x^2 - 4/5x + 1/5) = a(x^4 - 24/5x^3 + 42/5x^2 - 24/5x + 1).\n\nFrom this expression, we can see that a, b, and c are in the ratio 1 : -24/5 : 42/5. \n\nSince a, b, and c are integers with a greatest common divisor of 1, we have (a, b, c) = (5, -24, 42) or (a, b, c) = (-5, 24, -42). \n\nIn either case, the absolute value of c is 42.

If we have u = v + wi = re^(i\u03b8), then the imaginary part of sqrt(u) is \u00b1 sqrt(r) * sin(i\u03b8/2) = \u00b1 sqrt(r) * sqrt((1 - cos(\u03b8)) / 2) = \u00b1 sqrt((r - v) / 2).\n\nWe can now let u = -5/4 + c, which means v = -5/4 + a and w = b. We also have r = sqrt(v^2 + w^2).\n\nFor the imaginary part of z to be greater than 0, we need \u00b1 sqrt((r - v) / 2) > 1/2. This is only true when we take the positive sign and r - v > 1/2.\n\nSimplifying this, we get v^2 + w^2 > (1/2 + v)^2 = 1/4 + v + v^2, which gives us w^2 > 1/4 + v, or b^2 > a - 1.\n\nIn other words, for all z, f(z) = a + bi satisfies b^2 > a - 1, and there is one and only one z that makes this true.

Then y squared equals x squared plus 2 plus 1 over x squared, so x squared plus 1 over x squared equals y squared minus 2. Thus, we can rewrite the equation above as 6 times y squared minus 2 minus 35y plus 62 equals 0. This simplifies to 6y squared minus 35y plus 50 equals 0.

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we first put the given expression over a common denominator. The expression is (x + y)/(x - y) + (x - y)/(x + y). When we put this over a common denominator, we get (2x^2 + 2y^2)/(x^2 - y^2) = 1. \n\nThen, we can simplify this equation to 2x^2 + 2y^2 = x^2 - y^2, which gives us x^2 = -3y^2.\n\nNext, we need to find the value of (x^4 + y^4)/(x^4 - y^4) + (x^4 - y^4)/(x^4 + y^4). We can substitute x^2 = -3y^2 into this expression to get (9y^4 + y^4)/(9y^4 - y^4) + (9y^4 - y^4)/(9y^4 + y^4).\n\nSimplifying this, we get (10/8) + (8/10), which is equal to (5/4) + (4/5). \n\nTo add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 20.

        "answer": "To rationalize the denominator, we start by multiplying the given fraction by its conjugate over itself to eliminate the radical in the denominator. \n\nWe begin with the expression 1 divided by x minus the square root of x squared minus 1. To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by x plus the square root of x squared minus 1. This gives us x plus the square root of x squared minus 1, all divided by x squared minus the square root of x squared minus 1, squared, which simplifies to x plus the square root of x squared minus 1, all divided by x squared minus x squared plus 1. Simplifying further, we get x plus the square root of x squared minus 1, all divided by 1, which simplifies to x plus the square root of x squared minus 1.\n\nGiven the equation 2 times x plus 2 times the square root of x squared minus 1 equals 20, we can simplify this to x plus the square root of x squared minus 1 equals 10. By rearranging terms, we find that the square root of x squared minus 1 equals 10 minus x. To solve for x, we square both sides of the equation, resulting in x squared minus 1 equals 100 minus 20 times x plus x squared. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get 20 times x equals 101, which gives us x equals 101 divided by 20. \n\nUsing a similar approach for the expression 1 divided by x squared plus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1, we multiply the numerator and denominator by x squared minus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1. This simplifies to x squared minus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1, all divided by x to the power of 4 minus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1, squared, which further simplifies to x squared minus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1, all divided by x to the power of 4 minus x to the power of 4 plus 1. Simplifying further, we get x squared minus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1.\n\nNow, given the equation x squared plus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1, plus 1 divided by x squared plus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1, equals 2 times x squared, we can substitute the simplified expression x squared minus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1 for 1 divided by x squared plus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1. \n\nThis gives us x squared plus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1, plus x squared minus the square root of x to the power of 4 minus 1, equals 2 times x squared. Simplifying this equation, we get 2 times x squared equals 2 times x squared. \n\nSince x equals 101 divided by 20, we can substitute this value into the equation 2 times x squared, giving us 2 times the square of 101 divided by 20.

        "answer": "The equation of the parabola can be expressed as y equals a times the quantity x minus one fourth squared minus nine eighths. Expanding this, we find that y equals a times the quantity x squared minus x over 2 plus one sixteenth minus nine eighths, which equals a x squared minus a x over 2 plus a over 16 minus nine eighths. From the problem, we know that the parabola can be expressed in the form y equals a x squared plus b x plus c, where a plus b plus c is an integer. From the above equation, we can conclude that a equals a, b equals negative a over 2, and c equals a over 16 minus nine eighths. Adding up all of these gives us a plus b plus c equals nine a minus 18 over 16, which equals nine times the quantity a minus 2 over 16. Let n equal a plus b plus c. Then nine a minus 18 over 16 equals n, so a equals 16 n plus 18 over 9. For a to be positive, we must have 16 n plus 18 greater than 0, or n greater than negative nine eighths.

        "answer": "Setting y equal to 0 in the given functional equation, we get f(0) + x = xf(0) + f(x), so f(x) = (1 - f(0))x + f(0). This tells us that f(x) is a linear function of the form f(x) = mx + b. Since f(-1) = 5, 5 = -m + b, so b = m + 5, and f(x) = mx + m + 5. Substituting this into the given functional equation, we get mxy + m + 5 + x = x(my + m + 5) + mx + m + 5. This simplifies to 2mx = -4x. For this to hold for all x, we must have m = -2.

        "answer": "The equation of the tangent at point A = (1,1) is of the form y - 1 = m(x - 1), or y = mx - m + 1. Substituting into y = x^2, we get mx - m + 1 = x^2. Then x^2 - mx + m - 1 = 0. Since we have a tangent, this quadratic should have a double root. And since the x-coordinate of A is 1, the double root is x = 1. Hence, this quadratic is identical to (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1, which means m = 2.\n\nThen the slope of the normal is -1/2, so the equation of the normal is y - 1 = -1/2 (x - 1). We want the intersection of the normal with y = x^2, so we set y = x^2: x^2 - 1 = -1/2 (x - 1). We can factor the left-hand side: (x - 1)(x + 1) = -1/2 (x - 1). The solution x = 1 corresponds to the point A. Otherwise, x is not equal to 1, so we can divide both sides by x - 1: x + 1 = -1/2. Hence, x = -3/2, so the intersection point is (-3/2, 9/4). \n\nThe answer is (-3/2, 9/4)."

        "answer": "Let's consider the expressions in the denominators. Since a + b + c = 0, we can derive the following equation: a^2 - bc = (-b - c)^2 - bc = b^2 + bc + c^2 = b^2 + c(b + c) = b^2 - ac. Similarly, we can prove that b^2 - ac = c^2 - ab.\n\nLet x = a^2 - bc = b^2 - ac = c^2 - ab. Then the sum is (a^2 * b^2 + a^2 * c^2 + b^2 * c^2) / x^2. Note that x^2 = (a^2 - bc) * (b^2 - ac) = a^2 * b^2 - a^3 * c - b^3 * c + a * b * c^2 = a^2 * b^2 - (a^3 + b^3) * c + a * b * c^2 = a^2 * b^2 - (a + b) * (a^2 - a * b + b^2) * c + a * b * c^2 = a^2 * b^2 + (a^2 - a * b + b^2) * c^2 + a * b * c^2 = a^2 * b^2 + a^2 * c^2 + b^2 * c^2.\n\nTherefore, (a^2 * b^2 + a^2 * c^2 + b^2 * c^2) / x^2 = 1. Thus, the given expression can only be equal to 1."

This in turn simplifies to x squared minus 2xy plus y squared is greater than or equal to 0.

        "answer": "From the given equation, we can determine the degree of the function f(x). The degree of the function 2013x times the sum of f(x-1), f(x), and f(x+1) is d + 1, where d is the degree of f(x). The degree of the square of f(x) is 2d. Since these two expressions are equal, we can set up the equation 2d = d + 1 and solve for d. This gives us d = 1, which means f(x) is a linear function.\n\nWe can write f(x) as ax + b, where a and b are constants. Substituting this into the given equation, we get 2013x times the sum of a(x-1) + b, ax + b, and a(x+1) + b, which equals the square of ax + b. Simplifying this equation, we get 2013x times 3ax + 3b, which equals the square of ax + b.\n\nThis can be rewritten as the square of f(x) equals 6039xf(x). This gives us two possible solutions: f(x) equals 0, or f(x) equals 6039x. Since f(x) is non-constant, we can discard the first solution and conclude that f(x) equals 6039x. \n\nTherefore, f(1) equals 6039. We can verify that f(x) equals 6039x satisfies the given equation. \n\nThe answer is 6039."

If the area of the triangle is between 8 and 64 inclusive, find all possible values of r. Express your answer in interval notation.",
        "answer": "The x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is -b divided by 2a, which equals 0 divided by 2 times 1, equaling 0. The vertex is then 0, -1. The intersections of the line y = r with y = x^2 - 1 are found by setting the y values equal to each other, so r = x^2 - 1, which implies r + 1 = x^2, which implies plus or minus the square root of r + 1 = x. \n\nSo the vertices of our triangle are 0, -1, negative square root of r + 1, r, and square root of r + 1, r. If we take the horizontal segment along the line y = r to be the base of the triangle, we can find its length as the difference between the x-coordinates, which is square root of r + 1 - negative square root of r + 1 = 2 times square root of r + 1. \n\nThe height of the triangle is the distance from 0, -1 to the line y = r, or r + 1. So the area of the triangle is A = one half times b times h = one half times 2 times square root of r + 1 times r + 1 = r + 1 times square root of r + 1. This can be expressed as r + 1 raised to the power of three halves.\n\nWe have 8 less than or equal to A less than or equal to 64, so 8 less than or equal to r + 1 raised to the power of three halves less than or equal to 64. Taking the cube root of all three sides gives 2 less than or equal to r + 1 raised to the power of one half less than or equal to 4, and squaring gives 4 less than or equal to r + 1 less than or equal to 16. Finally, subtract 1 to find 3 less than or equal to r less than or equal to 15. In interval notation, this is 3 to 15. \n\nThe answer is [3,15]."

The equation is log base 2 of the product of two fractions, which can be simplified by canceling out the common factor of 5x - 3. This leaves us with log base 2 of the fraction (3x + 9) / (x - 2) equals 2.\n\nNext, eliminate the log by rewriting the equation in exponential form. This gives us the fraction (3x + 9) / (x - 2) equals 2 squared, which equals 4.\n\nNow, solve for x by cross-multiplying and simplifying the equation. Multiply both sides by x - 2 to get 3x + 9 equals 4 times x minus 8. Simplify this to get 3x + 9 equals 4x - 8.\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides to get 9 equals x - 8.

From these equations, c equals 2b minus a, and the square of 2b minus a equals ab. Then 4b squared minus 4ab plus a squared equals ab, so a squared minus 5ab plus 4b squared equals 0.

Using the AM-GM inequality, we get a^2 + kb^2 >= 2ab sqrt(k) and (1 - k)b^2 + c^2 >= 2bc sqrt(1 - k).\n\nTo get a multiple of 2ab sqrt(2) + 2bc, we want to find a value of k such that 2 sqrt(k) / 2 sqrt(2) = 2 sqrt(1 - k) / 2.

This is because both equations are quadratics in x, so they both have exactly two roots for x.\n\nTo find the roots, we need to solve x = f(x), or x = sqrt(19) + 91/x. Multiplying both sides by x gives us x^2 = sqrt(19)x + 91.

Note that the roots a, b, and c are positive.\n\nWe have s squared = a + b + c + 2 times the square root of ab + 2 times the square root of ac + 2 times the square root of bc = 9 + 2 times the square root of ab + the square root of ac + the square root of bc, so s squared - 9 = 2 times the square root of ab + the square root of ac + the square root of bc.\n\nSquaring this equation, we get s to the power of 4 - 18 times s squared + 81 = 4 times ab + ac + bc + 2 times the square root of ab times the square root of ac + 2 times the square root of ab times the square root of bc + 2 times the square root of ac times the square root of bc.\n\nThis simplifies to s to the power of 4 - 18 times s squared + 81 = 4 times 11 + 2 times the square root of abc times the square root of a + the square root of b + the square root of c, which is equal to 4 times 11 + 2 times s.\n\nTherefore, s to the power of 4 - 18 times s squared + 81 = 44 + 8 times s, so s to the power of 4 - 18 times s squared - 8 times s + 37 = 0.\n\nThus, s to the power of 4 - 18 times s squared - 8 times s = -37."

        "question": "Suppose z and w are complex numbers such that the absolute value of z is equal to the absolute value of w, and the sum of z times the conjugate of w and the conjugate of z times w is equal to 1. Find the largest possible value of the real part of the sum of z and w.",
        "answer": "The problem gives that z = a + bi and w = c + di, where a, b, c, and d are complex numbers. From the given conditions, |z| = 1 and |w| = 1, which implies that a^2 + b^2 = 1 and c^2 + d^2 = 1. Also, from z * conjugate(w) + conjugate(z) * w = 1, we get (a + bi)(c - di) + (a - bi)(c + di) = 1, which simplifies to 2ac + 2bd = 1.\n\nNow, let's expand (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2. This equals a^2 + 2ac + c^2 + b^2 + 2bd + d^2, which further simplifies to (a^2 + b^2) + (c^2 + d^2) + (2ac + 2bd). We know that a^2 + b^2 = 1, c^2 + d^2 = 1, and 2ac + 2bd = 1. Therefore, (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe real part of z + w is a + c, and we want to find the maximum possible value of a + c. Since (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 = 3, the maximum value of a + c occurs when (a + c)^2 is maximum. The maximum value of (a + c)^2 is 3, which implies that the maximum value of a + c is sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the largest possible value of a + c is sqrt(3), which occurs when z = sqrt(3)/2 + (1/2)i and w = sqrt(3)/2 - (1/2)i. \n\nThe answer is sqrt(3)."

        "answer": "Since the sign of (x + y) can be -1, 0, or 1, z can be 4037, 2018, or -1. The same holds for x and y. But we can then check that x + y cannot be 0, so z can only be 4037 or -1. And again, the same holds for x and y.\n\nIf any two of x, y, and z are equal to -1, then the third must be equal to 4037. Conversely, if any of x, y, z are equal to 4037, then the other two must be equal to -1. Therefore, the only solutions are (4037,-1,-1), (-1,4037,-1), and (-1,-1,4037), giving us 3 solutions."

        "question": "Square ABCD is inscribed in the region bound by the parabola y = x^2 - 8x + 12 and the x-axis. Find the area of square ABCD.",
        "answer": "Note that the axis of symmetry of the parabola is x = 4. \n\nLet 2t be the side length of the square. Then the coordinates of the square are A = (4 - t, 0), B = (4 + t, 0), C = (4 + t, -2t), and D = (4 - t, -2t).\n\nSince point C lies on the parabola y = x^2 - 8x + 12, we can substitute the x and y values of point C into the equation of the parabola to get -2t = (4 + t)^2 - 8(4 + t) + 12.\n\nSimplifying this equation gives -2t = t^2 + 8t + 16 - 32 - 8t + 12, which simplifies further to -2t = t^2 - 4.\n\nRearranging this equation gives t^2 + 2t - 4 = 0. Solving for t using the quadratic formula gives t = (-2 \u00b1 sqrt(2^2 - 4*1*(-4))) / 2*1, which simplifies to t = (-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 16)) / 2, and further to t = (-2 \u00b1 sqrt(20)) / 2, and then to t = (-2 \u00b1 2*sqrt(5)) / 2, and finally to t = -1 \u00b1 sqrt(5).\n\nSince t is half the side length of the square, it must be positive. Therefore, t = -1 + sqrt(5). \n\nThe area of the square is (2t)^2, which is (2*(-1 + sqrt(5)))^2, and this simplifies to (2*(-1) + 2*sqrt(5))^2, which is (-2 + 2*sqrt(5))^2, and this simplifies to 4 - 8*sqrt(5) + 20, which simplifies further to 24 - 8*sqrt(5). \n\nThe answer is 24 - 8 sqrt(5)."

        "answer": "The sum S is equal to a series that converges to a specific value. To find this value, we start by writing out the series: S = (4/k) + (9/k^2) + (14/k^3) + ... . Multiplying both sides by k gives us kS = 4 + (9/k) + (14/k^2) + (19/k^3) + ... . \n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get (k-1)S = 4 + (5/k) + (5/k^2) + (5/k^3) + ... . We can rewrite the right-hand side as 4 + (5/k) / (1 - 1/k), which simplifies to 4 + (5/k) / ((k-1)/k), and further simplifies to 4 + (5/(k-1)).\n\nThis gives us (k-1)S = 4 + (5/(k-1)), which we can rewrite as (k-1)S = (4k + 1)/(k-1). Solving for S, we get S = (4k + 1)/(k-1)^2.\n\nWe are given that S = 13/4, so we set (4k + 1)/(k-1)^2 = 13/4. Cross-multiplying gives us 16k + 4 = 13(k^2 - 2k + 1). Rearranging the terms, we get 13k^2 - 42k + 9 = 0.\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get (k - 3)(13k - 3) = 0. This gives us two possible values for k: k = 3 or k = 3/13.

        "answer": "Solution 1: Since p(x) has real coefficients and has 3-2i as a root, it also has the complex conjugate, 3+2i, as a root. The quadratic that has 3-2i and 3+2i as roots is (x - (3-2i))(x - (3+2i)) = (x-3+2i)(x-3-2i) = (x-3)^2 - (2i)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 + 4 = x^2 - 6x + 13. By the Factor Theorem, we know that x^2 - 6x + 13 divides p(x). Since p(x) is cubic, it has one more root r. We can now write p(x) in the form p(x) = a(x^2 - 6x + 13)(x-r). Moreover, a = 1, because we are given that p(x) is monic. Substituting x = 0, we have p(0) = -13r, but we also know that p(0) = -52, therefore r = 4. Hence we have p(x) = (x^2 - 6x + 13)(x-4) = x^3 - 10x^2 + 37x - 52.\n\nSolution 2: Since p(x) has real coefficients and has 3-2i as a root, it also has the complex conjugate, 3+2i, as a root. The sum and product of these two roots, respectively, are 6 and 3^2 - (2i)^2 = 13. Thus, the monic quadratic that has these two roots is x^2 - 6x + 13. By the Factor Theorem, we know that x^2 - 6x + 13 divides p(x). Since p(x) is cubic, it has one more root r. Because p(0) equals the constant term, and because p(x) is monic, Vieta's formulas tell us that (3-2i)(3+2i)r = (-1)^3(-52) = 52. Thus r = 4, and p(x) = (x^2 - 6x + 13)(x-4) = x^3 - 10x^2 + 37x - 52.\n\nThe final answer is x^3 - 10x^2 + 37x - 52."
